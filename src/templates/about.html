<h1>About this work</h1>

<p>The QuJing reflects my personal curiosity in studying the classical work Yi Jing (I Ching), The Book of Changes. In studying this work I've become frustrated with available online publications of it for the reasons I will discuss now. The QuJing is my attempt at making the Yi Jing more accessible, comprehensive, aesthetically pleasing and interesting for old and new explorers of  the Yi Jing alike.<p>

<h2>The problem with Coins</h2>
<p>
My main concern with current online publications of the Yi Jing, and indeed the whole tradition of the Yi Jing, is the divination process. Or more precisely, the root of the supposedly divinatory powers: the production of hexagram lines from random numbers. These random numbers was traditionally generated by throwing 49 pieces of yarrow stalk in piles, sizing up the piles and assigning numbers according to the sizes of the piles. Since this method was unneseccarily cumbersome, other methods for the production of random numbers have become more popular, most notably the "Three Coins" method, in which three coins are cast and the outcome, considered random, is used to construct a line in the hexagram.
</p>
<p>On close inspection and reflection it seems quite obvious to mee that the Three Coin model is flawed in (at least) two fundamental ways. <i>Firstly</i> the number preduced by the three coins is only pseudo-random. That is, if we had enough information about the coins (classically definable position and momentum) the outcome becomse quite predictable indeed. <i>Secondly</i>, the distribution of outcomes by the three coin method is different from that of the original yarrow stalk method. The yarrow stalk method produces hexagram lines with the following asymmetrical probabilities: old yin (1/16), yin (7/16), old yang (3/16) and yang (5/16). The three coin model has the following probabilities: old yin (2/16), yin (6/16), old yang (2/16) and yang (6/16). </p>

<h2>Does it matter?</h2>
<p>
The divination can be broken down into the following steps: 1) generate random number -> 2) construct line based on that number -> 3) repeat six times -> 4) map the hexagram to a dequence of meaning -> 5) meditate on the meaning.  
</p>
<p> 
The Three Coin method affects the first two steps in the process. If we suppose that the usefullness of the outcome of the divination process is fundamentally based on unpredictable, random event; then surely the use of a method that produces only pseudo-random numbers is unsatisfying. A pseudo-random event is simply the outcome of a chaotic system doing it's completely deterministic, in theory knowable thing. In my mind, by using such pseudo randoness as a source of divination is not only undermining the usefullness of the Yi Jing as an every day tool for guidance, it misses the deeper philosophical (metaphysical) points of the Yi Jing completely.</p>
<p>
But in a way, the bigger foul of the three coin method is that it will produce widely different hexagrams than the original yarrow stalk method! The Yarrow Stalk method produces asymmetrical outcomes. Consider this: it three times more likely to get an old yang than an old yin with the yarrow stalks. With three coins, the probability for old yin and yang is the same.
</p>
<p>
 This two issues compound. Not only do we not use a truly random number to construct our hexagram, but even if we did the outcomes have nothing to do with how the original Yi Jing was thought to be interpreted. <i>Divination with the Three Coin model is therefore utterly useless.</i> 
</p>

<h2>A better way</h2> 
<p>How do we solve this? As the name Quantum Yi Jing would suggest, we apply something that we have learned by studying the behaviour of atoms. There are many quite interesting phenomena in quantum physics displaying the type of behaviour we are looking for. One such phenomena is the decay of radio active atoms. When we study such atoms (Ceasium-137, for example) we quickly realise that the exact moment of decay, as indicated by the emitting of an alpha particle by the atom, is fundamentally unknowable. It doesn't matter how many previous events we have previously witnessed - there is simply no way to tell when the next decay will happen! This it the type of phenomena we can use the produce truly random numbers.
</p>
<p>
 Once we have truly random numbers the second issue is trivial to remedy. To do this, the QuJing implements the Four Coin model. Four numbers (0 or 1 = heads or tails) is produced through observing quantum randomness. The four ones and zeroes represent a binary number between 0 and 15 where 0 is old yin (1/16), 1 - 3 is old yang (3/16), 4 - 8 is yang (5/16) and the rest, 9 - 15 is yin (7/16). As you can see, this distribution is identical to the yarrow stalk method. 
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	I have come to believe with good reason that the usefullness of the Yi Jing can be improved in two important ways: 
 <br> 1) exploit quantum phenomena which are objectively random for number generation, and </br> 2) use a mapping model that produces the same distribution of outcomes as the traditional Yarrow Stalk method.
</p>
<p>
	The Quantum Yi Jing implementation takes this into consideration to make a better Yi Jing Oracle which more closely resembes the traditional, good ol' way of doing things, but with the aid of modern technology.
</p>
<p>
	I feel deeply that this can help us become more at peace with ourselves and one another.'
