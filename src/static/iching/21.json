	"description" : "This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram   <a href=\"http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#27\">27</a> with an obstruction (in the fourth place) between the teeth. As a result the lips cannot meet. To bring them together one must bite energetically through the obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and for lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature. Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of Sung, CONFLICT   <a href=\"http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#6\">6</a>, which refers to civil suits.",
