1. Ch'ien / The Creative
------------------------

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN 
below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken
lines stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong,
and of the spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and
since it is without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image
is  heaven. Its energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions
in space and is therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the
basis of this motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time
and  the power of persisting in time, that is, duration.  The power represented
by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense in terms of its action
on the universe and of its action on the world of men. In relation to the
universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity.
In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of the holy
man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power awakens
and develops their higher nature.

### THE JUDGMENT

THE CREATIVE works sublime success, furthering through perseverance.

According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality
of success, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual
draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal
depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his
happiness  and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance
in  what is right.   The specific meanings of the four attributes became
the subject of speculation  at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered
by "sublime" means literally  "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius
says in explaining it: "Great  indeed is the generating power of the Creative;
all beings owe their beginning  to it. This power permeates all heaven."
For this attribute inheres in the  other three as well.  The beginning of
all things lies still in the beyond  in the form of ideas that have yet to
become real. But the Creative furthermore  has power to lend form to these
archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in  the word success, and the process
is represented by an image from nature:  "The clouds pass and the rain does
its work, and all individual beings flow  into their forms."  Applies to
the human world, these attributes show the  great man the way to notable
success: "Because he sees with great clarity  and cause and effects, he completes
the six steps at the right time and mounts  toward heaven on them at the
right time, as though on six dragons." The six  steps are the six different
positions given in the hexagram, which are represented  later by the dragon
symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies  in apprehending and
giving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which,  as a law running
through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in  time. Thus each
step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next.  Time is no longer
a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.   The act of
creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity  and success,
the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous actualization  and differentiation
of form. This is expressed in the two terms "furthering"  (literally, "creating
that which accords with the nature of a given being")  and "persevering"
(literally, "correct and firm"). "The course of the Creative  alters and
shapes beings until each attains its true, specific nature, then  it keeps
them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus does it show itself  to further
through perseverance."  In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the
great man brings peace and security to the world through his activity in
creating order: "He towers high above the multitude of beings, and all lands
are united in peace."  Another line of speculation goes still further in
separating the words "sublime," "success," "furthering," "perseverance,"
and parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity,
which, as the fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes,
it  links love. To the attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate
and organize expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute
furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which
each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and
which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated
with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can
therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already broached
in the commentary called WÃªn Yen , later formed the bridge connecting
the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) of change," as laid down in
the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of Changes,
which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative principles.
In the course of time this combination of the two systems of thought opened
the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.

### THE IMAGE

The movement of heaven is full of power. 
Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.

Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien,
of which heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete
revolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means
that each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time.
Since     it is the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also
created   the  idea of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that
never stops   nor  slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending
course. This   duration  in time is the image of the power inherent in the
Creative.   With  this image  as a model, the sage learns how best to develop
himself so that  his influence  may endure. He must make himself strong in
every way, by consciously   casting  out all that is inferior and degrading.
Thus he attains that tirelessness    which depends upon consciously limiting
the fields of his activity.


2. K'un / The Receptive
-----------------------

above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH 
below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken lines represents
the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the
hexagram  is devotion; its image is the earth.  It is the perfect complement
of THE  CREATIVE--the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does
not combat  the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast
to spirit,  earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal
as  against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the
principle  of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation
between  man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and
between father  and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears
in the coexistence  of the spiritual world and the world of the senses. 
But strictly speaking  there is no real dualism here, because there is a
clearly defined hierarchic  relationship between the two principles. In itself
of course the Receptive  is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute
of devotion defines  the place occupied by this primal power in relation
to the Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative;
then it is productive  of good. Only when it abandons this position and
tries  to stand as an equal  side by side with the Creative, does it become
evil.   The result then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative,
which  is productive of evil to both.

### THE JUDGMENT

THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success, 
Furthering through the perseverance of a mare. 
If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead, 
He goes astray; 
But if he follows, he finds guidance. 
It is favorable to find friends in the west and south, 
To forego friends in the east and north. 
Quiet perseverance brings good fortune. 

The four fundamental aspects of the Creative--"sublime success, furthering
through perseverance"--are also attributed to the Receptive.  Here, however,
the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive
connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of
the    Creative. The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial
through   a specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification,
"of  a mare,"   is here added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs
to  earth just   as the dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over
the  plains is  taken as a symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This
is the  symbol chosen  because the mare combines the strength and swiftness
of the  horse with the  gentleness and devotion of the cow.  Only because
nature in its myriad forms  corresponds with the myriad impulses of the Creative
can it make these impulses  real. Nature's richness lies in its power to
nourish all living things; its  greatness lies in its power to give then
beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers  all that lives. IT is the Creative
that begets things, but they are brought  to birth by the Receptive. Applied
to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in conformity
with the situation. The person in questions not in an independent position,
but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must achieve something.
It is not his task to try to lead--that would only make him lose the way-but
to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of
acceptance,  he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man lets
himself be guided;  he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the situation
what is demanded  of him and then follows this intimation from fate.  Since
there is something  to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in the
hour of toil and effort,  once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The
time of toil and effort  is indicated by the west and south, for west and
south symbolize the place  where the Receptive works for the Creative, as
nature does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize
all one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to
find friends there means to find guidance. But in addition   to the time
of toil and effort, there is also a time of planning, and for   this we need
this solitude. The east symbolized the place where a man receives   orders
from his master, and the north the place where he reports on what  he has
done. At that time he must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he
must do without companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled
by fictional hates and favoritism.

### THE IMAGE

The earth's condition is receptive devotion. 
Thus the superior man who has breadth of character 
Carries the outer world. 

Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth.
In the hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in
time, but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and
extension in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve
all things that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries
all things, good and evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior
man gives to his character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that
he is able both to support and to bear with people and things.


3. Chun / Difficulty at the Beginning
------------------------

above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER 
below  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing
against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth--hence the meaning,
"difficulty   at the beginning." The hexagram indicates the way in which
heaven and earth   bring forth individual beings. It is their first meeting,
which is beset  with difficulties. The lower trigram ChÃªn is the Arousing;
its motion  is upward and its image is thunder. The upper trigram K'an stands
for the  Abysmal, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is
rain. The  situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain
fill the  air. But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the upward
movement  eventually passes beyond the danger. A thunderstorm brings release
from tension,  and all things breathe freely again.

### THE JUDGMENT

DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING works supreme success, 
Furthering through perseverance. 
Nothing should be undertaken. 
It furthers one to appoint helpers. 

Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first
birth. But these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that
is  struggling to attain form . Everything is in motion: therefore if one
perseveres  there is a prospect of great success, in spite of the existing
danger. When  it is a man's fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything
is still unformed, dark. Hence he must hold back, because any premature
move  might bring disaster. Likewise, it is very important not to remain
alone;  in order to overcome the chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say,
however,  that he himself should look on passively at what is happening.
He must lend  his hand and participate with inspiration and guidance.

### THE IMAGE

Clouds and thunder:

The image of DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING.

Thus the superior man 
Brings order out of confusion. 

Clouds and thunder are represented by definite decorative lines; this
means that in the chaos of difficulty at the beginning, order is already
implicit. So too the superior man has to arrange and organize the inchoate
profusion of such times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads
from a knotted tangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find one's
place in the infinity of being, one must be able both to separate and to
unite.


4. MÃªng / Youthful Folly
------------------------

above  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN  
below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER

In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two different
ways. The image of the upper trigram, KÃªn, is the mountain, that
of   the lower, K'an, is water; the spring rising at the foot of the mountain
is the image of inexperienced youth. Keeping still is the attribute of
the   upper trigram; that of the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in
perplexity   on the brink of a dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of
youth. However,    the two trigrams also show the way of overcoming the follies
of youth. Water   is something that of necessity flows on. When the spring
gushes forth, it   does not know at first where it will go. But its steady
flow fills up the   deep place blocking its progress, and success is attained.

### THE JUDGMENT

YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success. 
It is not I who seek the young fool; 
The young fool seeks me. 
At the first oracle I inform him.  
If he asks two or three times, it is importunity. 
If he importunes, I give him no information. 
Perseverance furthers. 


In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite
of it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude
toward him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be
conscious     of his lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without
this modesty    and this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary
receptivity,    which should express itself in respectful acceptance of the
teacher. This    is the reason why the teacher must wait to be sought out
instead of offering    himself. Only thus can the instruction take place
at the right time and  in  the right way.  A teacher's answer to the question
of a pupil ought to  be  clear and definite like that expected from an oracle;
thereupon it ought   to be accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and
a basis for decision.   If mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept
up, it serves only to   annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence,
just as the oracle   gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions
implying doubt.    Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until
the points are mastered   one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus
the hexagram counsels the   teacher as well as the pupil.

### THE IMAGE

A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:
The image of YOUTH.

Thus the superior man fosters his character
By thoroughness in all that he does.

A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling
up all the hollow places in its path. In the same way character is developed
by thoroughness that skips nothing but, like water, gradually and steadily
fills up all gaps and so flows onward.



5. HsÃ¼ / Waiting (Nourishment)
------------------------------

above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER
below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

All beings have need of nourishment from above. But the gift of food
comes in its own time, and for this one must wait. This hexagram shows
the   clouds in the heavens, giving rain to refresh all that grows and to
provide   mankind with food and drink. The rain will come in its own time.
We cannot   make it come; we have to wait for it. The idea of waiting is
further suggested   by the attributes of the two trigrams--strength within,
danger in from. Strength  in the face of danger does not plunge ahead but
bides its time, whereas weakness  in the face of danger grows agitated and
has not the patience to wait.

### THE JUDGMENT

WAITING. If you are sincere,  
You have light and success. 
Perseverance brings good fortune. 
It furthers one to cross the great water. 

Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching
the goal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success.
This  leads to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power
to cross  the great water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome.
Weakness  and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up
to  his fate,  for his inner security enables him to endure to the end.
This   strength shows  itself in uncompromising truthfulness [with himself].
It  is only when we have the courage to face things exactly as they are,
without   any sort of self-deception or illusion, that a light will develop
out of  events, by which the path to success may be recognized. This recognition
must be followed by resolute and persevering action. For only the man who
goes to meet his fate resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately.
Then he will be able to cross the great water--that is to say, he will be
capable of making the necessary decision and of surmounting the danger.

### THE IMAGE

Clouds rise up to heaven: 
The image of WAITING. 
Thus the superior man eats and drinks, 
Is joyous and of good cheer.  

When clouds rise in the sky, it is a sign that it will rain. There
is nothing to do but to wait until after the rain falls. It is the same
in  life when destiny is at work. We should not worry and seek to shape
the  future  by interfering in things before the time is ripe. We should
quietly  fortify  the body with food and drink and the mind with gladness
and good  cheer. Fate  comes when it will, and thus we are ready.



6. Sung / Conflict
------------------------

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER

The upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward movement;
the lower trigram, water, in accordance with its nature tends downward. Thus
the two halves move away from each other, giving rise to the idea of conflict.
The attribute of the Creative is strength, that of the Abysmal is danger,
guile. Where cunning has force before it, there is conflict.  A third
indication    of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the combination
of deep   cunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A person of this
character   will certainly be quarrelsome.

### THE JUDGMENT

CONFLICT. You are sincere
And are being obstructed.
A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.
Going through to the end brings misfortune.
It furthers one to see the great man.
It does not further one to cross the great water.

Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs
into opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition
leads to craftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict.
If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being
so   clear-headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to
terms   by meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the
bitter  end has evil effects even when one is the right, because the enmity
is then  perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial
man whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably
or   assure a just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water
is to  be avoided, that is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because
in  order to be successful they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict
within  weakens the power to conquer danger without.

### THE IMAGE

Heaven and water go their opposite ways:
The image of CONFLICT.
Thus in all his transactions the superior man
Carefully considers the beginning.

The image indicates that the causes of conflict are latent in the
opposing tendencies of the two trig rams. Once these opposing tendencies
appear, conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be
taken carefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties
are exactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals
harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.



7. Shih / The Army
------------------

above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER

This hexagram is made up of the trigrams K'an, water, and K'un, earth,
and thus it symbolizes the ground water stored up in the earth. In the
same   way military strength is stored up in the mass of the people--invisible
in  times of peace but always ready for use as a source of power. The attributes
of the two trig rams are danger inside and obedience must prevail outside.
Of the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong
nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are
subordinate.    This line indicates a commander, because it stands in the
middle of one  of  the two trigrams. But since it is in the lower rather
than the upper trigram,  it represents not the ruler but the efficient general,
who maintains obedience  in the army by his authority.

### THE JUDGMENT

THE ARMY. The army needs perseverance
And a strong man.
Good fortune without blame.

An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting
force.
Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this
discipline     must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who
captures the    hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order
that he may  develop  his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his
ruler, who  must entrust   him with full responsibility as long as the war
lasts. But  war is always  a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction
and devastation.  Therefore   it should not be resorted to rashly but, like
a poisonous drug,  should be   used as a last recourse.

### THE IMAGE

In the middle of the earth is water:
The image of THE ARMY.

Thus the superior man increases his masses
By generosity toward the people.

Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way
the military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When
danger  threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger
threatens,  every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes
back  to his plow.  He who is generous toward the people wins their love,
and a  people living  under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only
a people  economically  strong can be important in military power. Such power
must therefore be cultivated  by improving the economic condition of the
people and by humane government.  Only when there is this invisible bond
between government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their
government as ground water is sheltered  by the earth, is it possible to
wage a victorious war.



8. Pi / Holding Together (union)
--------------------------------

above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER
below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

The waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever they
can, as for example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together.
Symbolically    this connotes holding together and the laws that regulate
it. The same idea   is suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram
except the fifth,   the place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines
hold together because   they are influenced by a man of strong will in the
leading position, a man   who is their center of union. Moreover, this strong
and guiding personality   in turn holds together with the others, finding
in them the complement of   his own nature.

### THE JUDGMENT

HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.
Inquire of the oracle once again
Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;
Then there is no blame.

Those who are uncertain gradually join.
Whoever come too late
Meets with misfortune.

What is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may
complement and aid one another through holding together. But such holding
together calls for a central figure around whom other persons may unite.
To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave matter
and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit,
consistency,   and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others
about him ask   himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone
attempting the   task without a real calling for it only makes confusion
worse than if no  union at all had taken place.  But when there is a real
rallying point, those  who at first are hesitant or uncertain gradually come
in of their own accord.   Late-comers must suffer the consequences, for in
holding together the question   of the right time is also important. Relationships
are formed and firmly  established according to definite inner laws. Common
experiences strengthen  these ties, and he who comes too late to share in
these basic experiences  must suffer for it if, as a straggler, he finds
the door locked.  If a man  has recognized the necessity for union and does
not feel strong enough to  function as the center, it is his duty to become
a member of some other organic  fellowship.

### THE IMAGE

On the earth is water:
The image of HOLDING TOGETHER.

Thus the kings of antiquity
Bestowed the different states as fiefs
And cultivated friendly relations
With the feudal lords.

Water fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to
it. The social organization of ancient China was based on this principle
of the holding together of dependents and rulers. Water flows to unite
with   water, because all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too
should   human society hold together through a community of interests that
allows  each individual to feel himself a member of a whole. The central
power of  a social organization must see to it that every member finds that
his true  interest lies in holding together with it, as was the case in the
paternal  relationship between king and vassals in ancient China.



9. Hsiao Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Small
---------------------------------------------

above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND
below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

This hexagram means the force of the small--the power of the shadowy--that
restrains, tames, impedes. A weak line in the fourth place, that of the
minister,  holds the five strong lines in check. In the Image it is the
wind  blowing  across the sky. The wind restrains the clouds, the rising
breath  of the Creative,  and makes them grow dense, but as yet is not strong
enough  to turn them to  rain. The hexagram presents a configuration of circumstances
in which a strong  element is temporarily held in leash by a weak element.
It is only through  gentleness that this can have a successful outcome.

### THE JUDGMENT

THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL
Has success.
Dense clouds, no rain from our western region.

This image refers to the state of affairs in China at the time when
King WÃªn, who came originally from the west, was in the east at
the    court of the reigning tyrant Chou Hsin. The moment for action on a
large   scale had not yet arrived. King WÃªn could only keep the tyrant
somewhat   in check by friendly persuasion. Hence the image of many clouds,
promising   moisture and blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls.
The situation   is not unfavorable; there is a prospect of ultimate success,
but there are   still obstacles in the way, and we can merely take preparatory
measures.  Only through the small means of friendly persuasion can we exert
any influence.   The time has not yet come for sweeping measures. However,
we may be able,   to a limited extent, to act as a restraining and subduing
influence. To carry  out our purpose we need firm determination within and
gentleness and adaptability   in external relations.

### THE IMAGE

The wind drives across heaven:
The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL.Thus the superior man
Refines the outward aspect of his nature.

The wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky; yet, being
nothing but air, without solid body, it does not produce great or lasting
effects. So also an individual, in times when he can produce no great
effect    in the outer world, can do nothing except refine the expression
of his nature   in small ways.



10. LÃ¼ / Treading (conduct)
---------------------------

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE

The name of the hexagram means on the one hand the right way of conducting
oneself. Heaven, the father, is above, and the lake, the youngest daughter,
is below. This shows the difference between high and low, upon which
composure     correct social conduct, depends. On the other hand the word
for the name    of the hexagram, TREADING, means literally treading upon
something. The  small   and cheerful [Tui] treads upon the large and strong
[Ch'ien]. The  direction   of movement of the two primary trigrams is upward.
The fact that  the strong   treads on the weak is not mentioned in the Book
of Changes, because it is   taken for granted. For the weak to take a stand
against the strong is not   dangerous here, because it happened in good humor
[Tui] and without presumption,   so that the strong man is not irritated
but takes it all in good part.

### THE JUDGMENT

TREADING. Treading upon the tail of the tiger.
It does not bite the man. Success.

The situation is really difficult. That which is strongest and that
which is weakest are close together. The weak follows behind the strong
and  worries it. The strong, however, acquiesces and does not hurt the
weak,   because  the contact is in goof humor and harmless.  In terms of
a human  situation,  one is handling wild, intractable people. In such a
case one's  purpose will  be achieved if one behaves with decorum. Pleasant
manners succeed  even with  irritable people.

### THE IMAGE

Heaven above, the lake below:
The image of TREADING.

Thus the superior man discriminates between high and low,
And thereby fortifies the thinking of the people.

Heaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres in
the natures of the two, hence no envy arises. Among mankind also there
are   necessarily differences of elevation; it is impossible to bring about
universal   equality. But it is important that differences in social rank
should not  be arbitrary and unjust, for if this occurs, envy and class
struggle  are the inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand, external
differences  in rank correspond with differences in inner worth, and if inner
worth forms   the criterion of external rank, people acquiesce and order
reigns in society.





11. T'ai / Peace
----------------

above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

The Receptive, which moves downward, stands above; the Creative, which
moves upward, is below. Hence their influences meet and are in harmony,
so  that all living things bloom and prosper. This hexagram belongs to
the   first  month (February-March), at which time the forces of nature prepare
the new  spring. 

### THE JUDGMENT


PEACE. The small departs,
The great approaches.
Good fortune. Success.

This hexagram denotes a time in nature when heaven seems to be on
earth. Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and so their powers unite
in deep harmony. Then peace and blessing descend upon all living things.
In the world of man it is a time of social harmony; those in high places
show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior is an end to all feuds.
In side, at the center, in the key position, is the light principle; the
dark principle is outside. Thus the light has a powerful influence, while
the dark is submissive. In this way each receives its due. When the good
elements of society occupy a central position and are in control, the evil
elements come under their influence and change for the better. When the spirit
of heaven rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its influence
and takes its appropriate place.   The individual lines enter the hexagram
from below and leave it again at the top. Here the small, weak, and evil
elements are about to take their departure, while the great, strong, and
good elements are moving up. This brings good fortune and success.

### THE IMAGE

Heaven and earth unite: the image of PEACE.
Thus the ruler
Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth,
And so aids the people.

Heaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences, producing
a time of universal flowering and prosperity. This stream of energy must
be regulated by the ruler of men. It is done by a process of division.
Thus   men divide the uniform flow of time into the seasons, according to
the succession    of natural phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the
points of the compass.   In this way nature in its overwhelming profusion
of phenomena is bounded  and controlled. One the other hand, nature must
be furthered in her productiveness.   This is done by adjusting the products
to the right time and the right place,   which increases the natural yield.
This controlling and furthering activity   of man in his relation to nature
is the work on nature that rewards him.





12. P'i / Standstill (Stagnation)
---------------------------------

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

This hexagram is the opposite of the preceding one. Heaven is above,
drawing farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther
into    the depths. The creative powers are not in relation. It is a time
of standstill    and decline. This hexagram is linked with the seventh month
(August-September),    when the year has passed its zenith and autumnal decay
is setting in.   

### THE JUDGMENT

STANDSTILL. Evil people do not further
The perseverance of the superior man.
The great departs; the small approaches.

Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed.
What is above has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion
and   disorder prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without.
Weakness  is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without
are the  superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of
superior   people  is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow
themselves   to be  turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting
influence   is  closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their
principles   and  withdraw into seclusion.

### THE IMAGE

Heaven and earth do not unite:
The image of STANDSTILL.
Thus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth 
In order to escape the difficulties.
He does not permit himself to be honored with revenue.

When, owing to the influence of inferior men, mutual mistrust prevails
in public life, fruitful activity is rendered impossible, because the
fundaments    are wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do
under such circumstances;   he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling
offers to take part in  public activities. This would only expose him to
danger, since he cannot  assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore
hides his worth and withdraws   into seclusion.





13. T'ung JÃªn / Fellowship with Men
-----------------------------------

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
below  LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME

The image of the upper trigram Ch'ien is heaven, and that of the lower,
Li, is flame. It is the nature of fire to flame up to the heaven. This
gives   the idea of fellowship. IT is the second line that, by virtue of
its central   character, unites the five strong lines around it. This hexagram
forms a  complement to Shih, THE ARMY 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#7">7</a>. In the latter, danger is within and obedience
without--the character of a warlike army, which, in order to hold together,
needs one strong man among the many who are weak. Here, clarity is within
and strength without--the character of a peaceful union of men, which, in
order to hold together, needs one yielding nature among many firm persons.

### THE JUDGMENT

FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN in the open.

Success.
It furthers one to cross the great water.
The perseverance of the superior man furthers.

True fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is universal.
It is not the private interests of the individual that create lasting
fellowship    among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it
is said that   fellowship with men in the open succeeds. If unity of this
kind prevails,   even difficult and dangerous tasks, such as crossing the
great water, can   be accomplished. But in order to bring about this sort
of fellowship, a persevering  and enlightened leader is needed--a man with
clear, convincing, and inspiring  aims and the strength to carry them out.
(The inner trigram means clarity;  the outer, strength.)

### THE IMAGE

Heaven together with fire:

The image of FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN.
Thus the superior man organizes the clans
And makes distinctions between things.

Heaven has the same direction of movement as fire, yet it is different
from fire. Just as the luminaries in the sky serve for the systematic
division    and arrangement of time, so human society and all things that
really belong    together must be organically arranged. Fellowship should
not be a mere mingling   of individuals or of things--that would be chaos,
not fellowship. If fellowship   is to lead to order, there must be organization
within diversity.





14. Ta Yu / Possession in Great Measure
---------------------------------------

above  LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME
below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

The fire in heaven above shines far, and all things stand out in the
light and become manifest. The weak fifth line occupies the place of
honor     and all the strong lines are in accord with it.All things come
to the man    who is modest and kind in a high position.

### THE JUDGMENT

POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.

Supreme success.

The two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite. Possessions
great measure is determined by fate and accords with the time. How is
it   possible that the weak line has power to hold the strong lines fast
and to  possess them? It is done by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time
is favorable--a   time of strength within, clarity and culture without. Power
is expressing   itself in graceful and controlled way. This brings supreme
success and wealth.

### THE IMAGE

Fire in heaven above:

The image of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.
Thus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good,
And thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven.

The sun in heaven above, shedding light over everything one earth,
is the image of possession on a grand scale. But a possession of this
sort    must be administered properly. The sun brings both evil and good
into the    light of day. Man must combat and curb the evil, and must favor
and promote    the good. Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent
will of God, who   desires only good and not evil.





15. Ch'ien / Modesty
--------------------

above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
below  KEN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

This hexagram is made up of the trigrams KÃªn, Keeping Still,
mountain, and K'un. The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative,
the    representative of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of
heaven,    the clouds and rain that gather round its summit, and thereafter
shines  forth  radiant with heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and
how it  functions  in great and strong men. K'un, the earth, stands above.
Lowliness  is a quality  of the earth: this is the very reason why it appears
in this  hexagram as exalted, by being placed above the mountain. This shows
how modesty  functions in lowly, simple people: they are lifted up by it.

### THE JUDGMENT

MODESTY creates success.

.  The superior man carries things through.

It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what
is modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law
of  heaven, turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a
new  dawn.  In obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins
to wane,  and  when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works
itself out  in  the fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the
full and to  contribute  to the modest. High mountains are worn down by the
waters, and  the valleys  are filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine
what is full  and to prosper  the modest. And men also hate fullness and
love the modest.   The destinies  of men are subject to immutable laws that
must fulfill themselves.  But man  has it in his power to shape his fate,
according as his behavior  exposes him to the influence of benevolent or
of destructive forces. When  a man holds  a high position and is nevertheless
modest, he shines with the  light of wisdom;  if he is in a lowly position
and is modest, he cannot be  passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out
his work to the end without  boasting of what he has achieved.

### THE IMAGE

Within the earth, a mountain:

The image of MODESTY.

Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,
And augments that which is too little.
He weighs things and makes them equal.

The wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not visible
to the eye, because the depths are offset by the height of the mountain.
Thus high and low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here
an effect that it took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems
easy of accomplishment and self-evident, is used as the image of modesty.
The superior man does the same thing when he establishes order in the world;
he equalizes the extremes that are the source of social discontent and thereby
creates just and equable conditions.







16. YÃ¼ / Enthusiasm
-------------------

above  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER
below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

The strong line in the fourth place, that of the leading official,
meets with response and obedience from all the other lines, which are
all    weak. The attribute of the upper trigram, ChÃªn, is movement;
the attributes   of K'un, the lower, are obedience and devotion. This begins
a movement that   meets with devotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm,
carrying all with  it. Of great importance, furthermore, is the law of movement
along the line  of least resistance, which in this hexagram is enunciated
as the law for natural events and for human life.

### THE JUDGMENT

ENTHUSIASM. It furthers one to install helpers
And to set armies marching.

The time of ENTHUSIASM derives from the fact that there is at hand
an eminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts
in accord with it. Hence he finds universal and willing obedience. To
arouse     enthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself and his
ordinances     to the character of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability
of natural     laws rests on this principle of movement along the line of
least resistance.     Theses laws are not forces external to things but represent
the harmony   of  movement immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies
do not deviate     from their orbits and why all events in nature occur with
fixed regularity.     It is the same with human society: only such laws are
rooted in popular   sentiment  can be enforced, while laws violating this
sentiment merely arouse   resentment.   Again, it is enthusiasm that enables
us to install helpers  for the completion  of an undertaking without fear
of secret opposition. It is enthusiasm too  that can unify mass movements,
as in war, so that they  achieve victory.

### THE IMAGE

Thunder comes resounding out of the earth:
The image of ENTHUSIASM.
Thus the ancient kings made music 
In order to honor merit,
And offered it with splendor
To the Supreme Deity,
Inviting their ancestors to be present.

When, at the beginning of summer, thunder--electrical energy--comes
rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes
nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make
themselves    felt. So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart
and to loosen    the grip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart
expresses itself    involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic
movement of the  body.  From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the
invisible sound that moves  all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified
mankind.  Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they elevated
and regulated  it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, designed
to purify  the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of
heroes and  thus to construct a bridge to the world of the unseen. In the
temple men drew near to God with music and pantomimes (out of this later
the theater developed). Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was
united with the most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the
ancestors. The ancestors were invited to these divine services as guests
of the Ruler of Heaven and as representatives of humanity in the higher regions.
This uniting of the human past with the Divinity in solemn moments of religious
inspiration established the bond between God and man. The ruler who revered
the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of Heaven,
in whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical contact.  These
ideas are the final summation of Chinese culture. Confucius has said of the
great sacrifice at which these rites were performed: "He who could wholly
comprehend this sacrifice could rule the world as though it were spinning
on his hand."





17. Sui / Following
-------------------

above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE
below  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

The trigram Tui, the Joyous, whose attribute is gladness, is above;
ChÃªn, the Arousing, which has the attribute of movement, is below.
Joy in movement induces following. The Joyous is the youngest daughter,
while   the Arousing is the eldest son. An older man defers to a young girl
and shows  her consideration. By this he moves her to follow him.

### THE JUDGMENT

FOLLOWING has supreme success.
Perseverance furthers. No blame.

In order to obtain a following one must first know how to adapt oneself.
If a man would rule he must first learn to serve, for only in this way
does   he secure from those below him the joyous assent that is necessary
if they   are to follow him. If he has to obtain a following by force or
cunning, by  conspiracy or by creating faction, he invariably arouses resistance,
which  obstructs willing adherence. But even joyous movement can lead to
evil consequences,  hence the added stipulation, "Perseverance furthers"
--that is, consistency  in doing right-- together with "No blame." Just as
we should not ask others  to follow us unless this condition is fulfilled,
so it is only under this  condition that we can in turn follow others without
coming to harm.   The  thought of obtaining a following through adaptation
to the demands of the  time is a great and significant idea; this is why
the appended judgment is  so favorable.

### THE IMAGE

Thunder in the middle of the lake:
The image of FOLLOWING.
Thus the superior man at nightfall
Goes indoors for rest and recuperation.

In the autumn electricity withdraws into the earth again and rests.
Here it is the thunder in the middle of the lake that serves as the image--thunder
in its winter rest, not thunder in motion. The idea of following in the
sense  of adaptation to the demands of the time grows out of this image.
Thunder  in the middle of the lake indicates times of darkness and rest.
Similarly,  a superior man, after being tirelessly active all day, allows
himself rest  and recuperation at night. No situation can become favorable
until one is  able to adapt to it and does not wear himself out with mistaken
resistance.




18. Ku / Work on what has been spoiled (Decay)
----------------------------------------------

above  KÃªn  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
below  Sun  THE GENTLE, WIND

The Chinese character ku represents a bowl in whose contents worms
are breeding. This means decay. IT is come about because the gentle indifference
in the lower trigram has come together with the rigid inertia of the
upper,     and the result is stagnation. Since this implies guilt, the conditions
embody   a demand for removal of the cause. Hence the meaning of the hexagram
is not  simply "what has been spoiled" but "work on what has been spoiled".

### THE JUDGMENT

WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED
Has supreme success.
It furthers one to cross the great water.
Before the starting point, three days.
After the starting point, three days.

What has been spoiled through man's fault can be made good again through
man's work. IT is not immutable fate, as in the time of STANDSTILL, that
has caused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom.
Work toward improving conditions promises well, because it accords the
possibilities    of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger-symbolized
by crossing    of the great water-but must take hold energetically. Success
depends, however,    on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the lines,
"Before the starting    point, three days. After the starting point, three
days." We must first  know  the cause of corruption before we can do away
with them; hence it is  necessary  to be cautious during the time before
the start. Then we must see to it that  the new way is safely entered upon,
so that a relapse may be avoided; therefore  we must pay attention to the
time after the start. Decisiveness and energy  must take the place of inertia
and indifference that have led to decay, in  order that the ending may be
followed by a new beginning. 

### THE IMAGE

The wind blows low on the mountain:
The image of DECAY.
Thus the superior man stirs up the people
And strengthens their spirit.

When the wind blow s slow on the mountain, it is thrown back and spoils
the vegetation. This contains a challenge to improvement. It is the same
with debasing attitudes and fashions; they corrupt human society. His
methods    likewise must be derived from the two trigrams, but in such a
way that their   effects unfold in orderly sequence. The superior must first
remove stagnation   by stirring up public opinion, as the wind stirs up everything,
and must  strengthen and tranquilize the character of the people, as the
mountain gives  tranquillity and nourishment to all that grows in its vicinity.





19. Lin / Approach
------------------

above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE

The Chinese word lin has a range of meanings that is not exhausted
by any single word of another language. The ancient explanations in the
Book  of Changes give as its first meaning, "becoming great." What becomes
great  are the two strong lines growing into the hexagram from below; the
light-giving  power expands with them. The meaning is then further extended
to include the concept of approach, especially the approach of what is
lower.   Finally the meaning includes the attitude of condescension of a
man in high   position toward the people, and in general the setting to work
on affairs.   This hexagram is linked with the twelfth month (January-February),
when after  the winter solstice, the light power begins to ascend again.

THE JUDGMENT

APPROACH has supreme success.
Perseverance furthers.
When the eighth month comes,

.  There will be misfortune.

The hexagram as a whole points to a time of joyous, hopeful progress.
Spring is approaching. Joy and forbearance bring high and low nearer
together.     Success is certain. But we must work with determination and
perseverance    to make full use of the propitiousness of the time. And on
thing more: spring    does not last forever. In the eighth month the aspects
are reversed. Then    only two strong, light lines are left; these do not
advance but are in retreat   (see next hexagram). We must take heed of this
change in good time. If we   meet evil before it becomes reality-before it
has even begun to stir-we  can  master it.

THE IMAGE

The earth above the lake:
The image of APPROACH.
Thus the superior man is inexhaustible
In his will to teach,
And without limits
In his tolerance and protection of the people.

The earth borders upon the lake from above. This symbolizes the approach
and condescension of the man of higher position to those beneath him.
The    two parts of the image indicate what his attitude toward these people
will    be. Just as the lake is inexhaustible in depth, so the sage is inexhaustible
in his readiness to teach mankind, and just as the earth is boundlessly
wide,  sustaining and caring for all creatures on it, so the sage sustains
and cares  for all people and excludes no part of humanity.


20. Kuan / Contemplation (View)
-------------------------------

above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND
below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

A slight variation of tonal stress gives the Chinese name for this
hexagram a double meaning.  It means both contemplating and being seen,
in  the sense of being an example. These ideas are suggested by the fact
that  the hexagram can be understood as picturing a type of tower characteristic
of ancient China.

A tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country; at the
same time, when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that could be
seen for miles around. Thus the hexagram shows a ruler who contemplates the
law of heaven above him and the ways of the people below, and who, by means
of good government, sets a lofty example to the masses.  This hexagram is
linked with the eight month (September-October). The light-giving power retreats
and the dark power is again on the increase. However, this aspect is
not    material in the interpretation of the hexagram as a whole.

THE JUDGMENT

CONTEMPLATION. The ablution has been made, 
But not yet the offering.
Full of trust they look up to him.

The sacrificial ritual in China began with an ablution and a libation
by which the Deity was invoked, after which the sacrifice was offered.
The   moment of time between these two ceremonies is the most sacred of
all,  the   moment of deepest inner concentration. If piety is sincere and
expressive     of real faith, the contemplation of it has a transforming
awe-spiring effect    on those who witness it.  Thus also in nature a holy
seriousness is to be   seen in the fact that natural occurrences are uniformly
subject to law.  Contemplation  of the divine meaning underlying the workings
of the universe  gives to the  man who is called upon to influence others
the means of producing  like effects.  This requires that power of inner
concentration which religious  contemplation  develops in great men strong
in faith. It enables them to apprehend the mysterious  and divine laws of
life, and by means of profoundest inner concentration they give expression
to these laws in their own persons. Thus a hidden spiritual  power emanates
from them, influencing and dominating others without their  being aware of
how it happens.   

THE IMAGE

The wind blows over the earth:
The image of CONTEMPLATION.
Thus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,
Contemplated the people,
And gave them instruction.

When the wind blows over the earth it goes far and wide, and the grass
must bend to its power. These two occurrences find confirmation in the
hexagram.   The two images are used to symbolize a practice of the kings
of old; in making  regular journeys the ruler could, in the first place,
survey his realm and  make certain that none of the existing usages of the
people escaped notice;  in the second, he could exert influence through which
such customs as were  unsuitable could be changed.  All of this points to
the power possessed by  a superior personality. On the one hand, such a man
will have a view of the  real sentiments of the great mass of humanity and
therefore cannot be deceived;  on the other, he will impress the people so
profoundly, by his mere existence  and by the impact of his personality,
that they will be swayed by him as the grass by the wind.




21.  Shih Ho / Biting Through
-----------------------------

above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE
below  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#27">27</a> with an obstruction (in the fourth place) between
the teeth. As a result the lips cannot meet. To bring them together one
must  bite energetically through the obstacle. Since the hexagram is made
up of  the trigrams for thunder and for lightning, it indicates how obstacles
are  forcibly removed in nature.
Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining
of  the lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing
tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances
of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme
of  this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of
Sung,  CONFLICT 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#6">6</a>, which refers to civil suits.

THE JUDGMENT

BITING THROUGH has success.
It is favorable to let justice be administered.

When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings
success. This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established,
the obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and
blocking the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be
taken at once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its
own accord. Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.
However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram combines
Li, clarity, and ChÃªn, excitement. Li is yielding, ChÃªn is hard.
Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out punishment;
unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two together create
the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes the decisions (represented
by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he commands respect by
his    conduct in his position.

THE IMAGE

Thunder and lighting:
The image of BITING THROUGH.
Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws
Through clearly defined penalties.


Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The lawsspecify
the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severepenalties are differentiated,
according to the nature of the crimes.This is symbolized by the clarity
of  lighting. The law is strengthenedby a just application of penalties.
This  is symbolized by the terrorof thunder. This clarity and severity have
the  effect of instillingrespect; it is not that the penalties are ends
in  themselves.The  obstructions in the social life of man increase when
there  is alack of clarity  in the penal codes and slackness in executing
them.The  only to strengthen  the law is to make it clear and make penaltiescertain
and swift.






22. Pi / Grace
--------------

above  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE

This hexagram shows a fire that breaks out of the secret depths of
the earth and, blazing up, illuminates and beautifies the mountain, the
heavenly  heights. Grace-beauty of form-is necessary in any union if it
is  to be well  ordered and pleasing rather than disordered and chaotic.

THE JUDGMENT

GRACE has success.
In small matters
It is favorable to undertake something.

Grace brings success. However, it is not the essential or fundamental
thing; it is only the ornament and therefore be used sparingly and only
in  little things. In the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between
two strong lines and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the
essential  content and the weak line is the beautifying form. In the upper
trigram of  the mountain, the strong line takes the lead, so that here
again   the strong  element must be regarded as the decisive factor. In nature
we   see in the sky the strong light of the sun; the life of the world depends
on it. But this strong, essential thing is changed and given pleasing variety
by the moon and the stars. In human affairs, aesthetic form comes into
being   when traditions exist that, strong and abiding like mountains, are
made pleasing  by a lucid beauty. By contemplating the forms existing in
the heavens we come to understand time and its changing demands. Through
contemplation of the forms existing in human society it becomes possible
to shape the world.

THE IMAGE

Fire at the foot of the mountain:

The image of GRACE.
Thus does the superior man proceed 
When clearing up current affairs.
But he dare not decide controversial issues in this way.

The fire, whose light illuminates the mountain and makes it pleasing,
does not shine far; in the same way, beautiful form suffices to brighten
and to throw light upon matters of lesser moment, but important questions
cannot be decided in this way. They require greater earnestness.





23. Po / Splitting Apart
------------------------

above  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE

The dark lines are about to mount upward and overthrow the last firm,
light line by exerting a disintegrating influence on it. The inferior,
dark   forces overcome what is superior and strong, not by direct means,
but by  undermining it gradually and imperceptibly, so that it finally collapses.
The lines of the hexagram present the image of a house, the top line
being    the roof, and because the roof is being shattered the house collapses.
The   hexagram belongs to the ninth month (October-November). The yin power
pushes   up ever more powerfully and is about to supplant the yang power
altogether.

THE JUDGMENT

SPLITTING APART. IT does not further one 
To go anywhere.

This pictures a time when inferior people are pushing forward and
are about to crowd out the few remaining strong and superior men. Under these
circumstances, which are due to the time, it is not favorable for the
superior    man to undertake anything.  The right behavior in such adverse
times is  to  be deduced from the images and their attributes. The lower
trigram stands    for the earth, whose attributes. The lower trigram stands
for the earth,   whose attributes are docility and devotion. The upper trigram
stands for  the mountain, whose attribute is stillness. This suggests that
one should  submit to the bad time and remain quiet. For it is a question
not of man's  doing but of time conditions, which, according to the laws
of heaven, show  an alternation of increase and decrease, fullness and emptiness.
It is impossible  to counteract these conditions of the time. Hence it is
not cowardice but  wisdom to submit and avoid action.

THE IMAGE

The mountain rests on the earth:
The image of SPLITTING APART.
Thus those above can ensure their position
Only by giving generously to those below.

The mountain rests on the earth. When it is steep and narrow, lacking
a broad base, it must topple over. Its position is strong only when it
rises   out of the earth broad and great, not proud and steep. So likewise
those  who rule rest on the broad foundation of the people. They too should
be generous   and benevolent, like the earth that carries all. Then they
will make their   position as secure as a mountain is in its tranquillity.






24. Fu / Return (The Turning Point)
-----------------------------------

above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
below  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

The idea of a turning point arises from the fact that after the dark
lines have pushed all of the light lines upward and out of the hexagram,
another light line enters the hexagram from below. The time of darkness
is  past. The winter solstice brings the victory of light. This hexagram
is linked  with the eleventh month, the month of the solstice (December-January).

THE JUDGMENT

RETURN. Success.
Going out and coming in without error.
Friends come without blame.
To and fro goes the way.
On the seventh day comes return.
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light
that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought
about by force. The upper trigram K'un is characterized by devotion; thus
the movement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the transformation
of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is introduced.
Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results. Societies
of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these groups come
together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish
separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. The idea of RETURN
is based on the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course
completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially.
Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is the meaning of
heaven and earth.   All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the
seventh brings return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of
the year begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so
too sunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven
is the number of the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the
great darkness, is increased by one. In this way the state of rest gives
place to movement.

THE IMAGE

Thunder within the earth:
The image of THE TURNING POINT.
Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes 
At the time of solstice.
Merchants and strangers did not go about,
And the ruler
Did not travel through the provinces.

The winter solstice has always been celebrated in China as the resting
time of the year--a custom that survives in the time of rest observed
at   the new year. In winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, the
Arousing,    is still underground. Movement is just at its beginning; therefore
it must    be strengthened by rest so that it will not be dissipated by being
used  prematurely.  This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing
itself  to be reinforced  by rest, applies to all similar situations. The
return of health after illness,  the return of understanding after an estrangement:
everything must be treated  tenderly and with care at the beginning, so
that  the return may lead to a  flowering.





25. Wu Wang / Innocence (The Unexpected)
----------------------------------------

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
below  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

Ch'ien, heaven is above; ChÃªn, movement, is below. The lower
trigram ChÃªn is under the influence of the strong line it has received
form above, from heaven. When, in accord with this, movement follows
the    law of heaven, man is innocent and without guile. His mind is natural
and    true, unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious
purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been
lost. Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate
nature. Starting out with the idea of the natural, the train of thought
in  part goes somewhat further and thus the hexagram includes also the idea
of  the fundamental or unexpected.

THE JUDGMENT

INNOCENCE. Supreme success.
Perseverance furthers.
If someone is not as he should be,
He has misfortune,
And it does not further him
To undertake anything.

Man has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him
in all his movements. By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he
attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive
sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage.
This instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and 'furthers through
perseverance". However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher
sense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will
of heaven. Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive
way of acting brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who
departs from innocence, what does he come to? Heaven's will and blessing
do not go with his deeds."

THE IMAGE

Under heaven thunder rolls:
All things attain the natural state of innocence.

Thus the kings of old,
Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,
Fostered and nourished all beings.

In springtime when thunder, life energy, begins to move again under
the heavens, everything sprouts and grows, and all beings receive for
the    creative activity of nature the childlike innocence of their original
state.    So it is with the good rulers of mankind: drawing on the spiritual
wealth    at their command, they take care of all forms of life and all forms
of culture   and do everything to further them, and at the proper time.





26. Ta Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Great
-------------------------------------------

above  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

The Creative is tamed by KÃªn, Keeping Still.  This produces
great power, a situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao
Ch'u, THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the
Gentle alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four
strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister,
there is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is afar stronger.
The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the
concept "Holding firm." Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of holding
firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram KÃªn which holds
the trigram ch'ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of
holding back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring
for and nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line
at the top, which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as
a sage. The third of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong
line at the top, which represents the sage.

THE JUDGMENT

THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.
Perseverance furthers.

Not eating at home brings good fortune.
It furthers one to cross the great water.

To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set
forth in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is
honored by the ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power;
KÃªn indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and
to the daily renewal of character. Only through such daily self-renewal can
a man continue at the height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep
order in quiet times; but in periods when there is a great storing up of
energy, everything depends on the power of the personality. However, since
the worthy are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted
with leadership by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather
to earn one's bread by entering upon public office. Such a man is in harmony
with heaven; therefore even great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing
the great water, succeed.

THE IMAGE

Heaven within the mountain:

The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.

Thus the superior man acquaints himself with many sayings of antiquity
And many deeds of the past,
In order to strengthen his character thereby.

Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures. In the words
and deeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that men may use to
strengthen   and elevate their own characters. The way to study the past
is not to confine   oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through application
of this knowledge,   to give actuality to the past.





27. I / Corners of the Mouth (Providing Nourishment)
----------------------------------------------------

above  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
below  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

This hexagram is a picture of an open mouth; above and below are firm
lines of the lips, and between them the opening. Starting with the mouth,
through which we take food for nourishment, the thought leads to nourishment
itself. Nourishment of oneself, specifically of the body, is represented
in the three lower lines, while the three upper lines represent nourishment
and care of others, in a higher, spiritual sense.

THE JUDGMENT

THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH.
Perseverance brings good fortune.
Pay heed to the providing of nourishment
And to what a man seeks

To fill his own mouth with.

In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right
people should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment
in the right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to
observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates
and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man fosters
and    takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men through
them.    Mencius says about this:

If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only
observe what part of his being he regards as especially important. The
body   has superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must
not injure  important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we
injure the superior  parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates
the inferior  parts of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the
superior parts  of his nature is a superior man.

THE IMAGE

At the foot of the mountain, thunder:

The image of PROVIDING NOURISHMENT.

Thus the superior man is careful of his words
And temperate in eating and drinking.

"God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing": when in the spring
the life forces stir again, all things comes into being anew. "He brings
to perfection in the sign of Keeping Still": thus in the early spring, when
the seeds fall to earth, all things are made ready. This is an image of providing
nourishment through movement and tranquillity.  The superior man takes it
as a pattern for the nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words
are a movement going form within outward. Eating and drinking are movements
from without inward. Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity.
For tranquillity keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding
proper measure, and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding
its proper measure. Thus character is cultivated.





28. Ta Kuo / Preponderance of the Great
---------------------------------------

above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE
below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD

This hexagram consists of four strong lines inside and two weak lines
outside. When the strong are outside and the weak inside, all is well
and    there is nothing out of balance, nothing extraordinary in the situation.
Here, however, the opposite is the case. The hexagram represents a beam
that  is thick and heavy in the middle but too weak at the ends. This is
a condition   that cannot last; it must be changed, must pass, or misfortune
will result.

THE JUDGMENT

PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.

The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

Success.

The weight of the great is excessive. The load is too heavy for the
strength of the supports. The ridgepole on which the whole roof rests,
sags   to the breaking point, because its supporting ends are too weak for
the load  they bear. It is an exceptional time and situation; therefore
extraordinary     measures are demanded. It is necessary to find a way of
transition as quickly    as possible, and to take action. This promises success.
For although the   strong element is in excess, it is in the middle, that
is, at the center   of gravity, so that a revolution is not to be feared.
Nothing is to be achieved    by forcible measures. The problem must be solved
by gently penetration to   the meaning of the situation (as is suggested
by the attribute of the inner   trigram, Sun); then the change-over to other
conditions will be successful.    It demands real superiority; therefore
the time when the great preponderates    is a momentous time.

THE IMAGE

The lake rises above the trees:

The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.

Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,
Is unconcerned,
And if he has to renounce the world,
He is undaunted.

Extraordinary times when the great preponderates are like flood times
when the lake rises over the treetops. But such conditions are temporary.
The two trigrams indicate the attitude proper to such exceptional times:
the symbol of the trigram Sun is the tree, which stands firm even though
it stands alone, and the attribute of Tui is joyousness, which remains
undaunted    even if it must renounce the world.





<a name="29"></a>
29. K'an / The Abysmal (Water)
------------------------------

above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER
below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER

This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K'an. It is one
of the eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram K'an means
a  plunging in. A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is
closed    in by them like water in a ravine. The trigram K'an is also the
middle son.   The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative,
and thus K'an   develops. As an image it represents water, the water that
comes from above   and is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving
rise to all life  on earth.   In man's world K'an represents the heart, the
soul locked up within the body, the principle of light inclosed in the dark--that
is, reason. The name of the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has
the additional meaning, "repetition of danger." Thus the hexagram is intended
to designate an objective situation to which one must become accustomed,
not a subjective attitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means
either foolhardiness or guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger;
it is a situation in which a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine,
and, like the water, he can escape if he behaves correctly.

THE JUDGMENT

The Abysmal repeated.
If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,
And whatever you do succeeds.

Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets
the example for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and
on, and merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does not
shrink from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make
it lose its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions.
Thus likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the
heart  can penetrate the meaning of the situation. And once we have gained
inner  mastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action
we take  will succeed. In danger all that counts is really carrying out
all  that has  to be done--thoroughness--and going forward, in order not
to perish  through  tarrying in the danger.  Properly used, danger can have
an important  meaning  as a protective measure. Thus heaven has its perilous
height protecting  it  against every attempt at invasion, and earth has its
mountains and bodies    of water, separating countries by their dangers.
Thus also rulers make use   of danger to protect themselves against attacks
from without and against   turmoil within.

THE IMAGE

Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its foal:

The image of the Abysmal repeated.

Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue
And carries on the business of teaching.

Water reaches its goal by flowing continually. It fills up every depression
before it flows on. The superior man follows its example; he is concerned
that goodness should be an established attribute of character rather
than     an accidental and isolated occurrence. So likewise in teaching others
everything    depends on consistency, for it is only through repetition that
the pupil   makes the material his own.





30. Li / The Clinging, Fire
---------------------------

above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE
below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE

This hexagram is another double sign. The trigram Li means "to cling
to something," and also "brightness." A dark line clings to two light
lines,    one above and one below--the image of an empty space between two
strong  lines,  whereby the two strong lines are made bright. The trigram
represents  the middle daughter. The Creative has incorporated the central
line of the  Receptive,  and thus Li develops. As an image, it is fire. Fire
has no definite  form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright.
As water pours down from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While
K'an means the soul shut within the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.

THE JUDGMENT

THE CLINGING. Perseverance furthers.
It brings success.
Care of the cow brings good fortune.

What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness
of the latter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself
something that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out.
Everything    that gives light is dependent on something to which it clings,
in order  that  it may continue to shine.  Thus the sun and moon cling to
heaven, and  grain,   grass, and trees cling to the earth. So too the twofold
clarity of the dedicated   man clings to what is right and thereby can shape
the world. Human life on  earth is conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes
this limitation  and makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent
forces of the cosmos, he achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme
docility. By cultivating in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary
dependence,   man acquires clarity without sharpness and finds his place
in the world.

THE IMAGE

That which is bright rises twice:

The image of FIRE.

Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,
Illumines the four quarters of the world.

Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day.
The two together represent the repeated movement of the sun, the function
of light with respect to time. The great man continues the work of nature
in the human world. Through the clarity of his nature he causes the light
to spread farther and farther and to penetrate the nature of man ever
more    deeply. 





31. Hsien / Influence (Wooing)
------------------------------

above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE
below  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

The name of the hexagram means "universal," "general," and in a figurative
sense "to influence," "to stimulate." The upper trigram is Tui, the Joyous;
the lower is KÃªn, Keeping still. By its persistent, quiet influence,
the lower, rigid trigram stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds
to this stimulation cheerfully and joyously. KÃªn, the lower trigram,
is the youngest son; the upper, Tui, is the youngest daughter. Thus the
universal  mutual attraction between the sexes is represented. In courtship,
the masculine  principle must seize the initiative and place itself below
the feminine principle.   Just as the first part of book 1 begins with
the   hexagrams of heaven and  earth, the foundations of all that exists,
the second  part begins with the  hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the
foundations   of all social relationships.

THE JUDGMENT

Influence. Success.
Perseverance furthers.

To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.

The weak element is above, the strong below; hence their powers attract
each other, so that they unite. This brings about success, for all success
depends on the effect of mutual attraction. By keeping still within while
experiencing joy without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess
and   hold it within proper bounds. This is the meaning of the added admonition,
"Perseverance furthers," for it is perseverance that makes the difference
between seduction and courtship; in the latter the strong man takes a
position    inferior to that of the weak girl and shows consideration for
her. This  attraction  between affinities is a general law of nature. Heaven
and earth  attract each  other and thus all creatures come into being. Through
such attraction the  sage influences men's hearts, and thus the world attains
peace. From the attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all beings
in heaven and on earth.

THE IMAGE

A lake on the mountain:

The image of influence.

Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him
By his readiness to receive them.

A mountain with a lake on its summit is stimulated by the moisture
from the lake. It has this advantage because its summit does not jut
out    as a peak but is sunken. The image counsels that the mind should be
kept   humble and free, so that it may remain receptive to good advice. People
soon  give up counseling a man who thinks that he knows everything better
than anyone else.




32. HÃªng / Duration
-------------------

above  CHEN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER
below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND

The strong trigram ChÃªn is above, the weak trigram Sun below.
This hexagram is the inverse of the preceding one. In the latter we have
influence, here we have union as an enduring condition. The two images
are   thunder and wind, which are likewise constantly paired phenomena. The
lower   trigram indicates gentleness within; the upper, movement without.
In the   sphere of social relationships, the hexagram represents the institution
of  marriage as the enduring union of the sexes. During courtship the young
man  subordinates himself to the girl, but in marriage, which is represented
by  the coming together of the eldest son and the eldest daughter, the husband
is the directing and moving force outside, while the wife, inside, is
gentle    and submissive.

THE JUDGMENT

DURATION. Success. No blame.
Perseverance furthers.
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

Duration is a state whose movement is not worn down by hindrances.
It is not a state of rest, for mere standstill is regression. Duration
is   rather the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an
organized,   firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable
laws and  beginning anew at every ending. The end is reached by an inward
movement,   by inhalation, systole, contraction, and this movement turns
into a new beginning,  in which the movement is directed outward, in exhalation,
diastole, expansion.   Heavenly bodies exemplify duration. They move in
their  fixed orbits, and  because of this their light-giving power endures.
The seasons of the year  follow a fixed law of change and transformation,
hence can produce effects  that endure.  So likewise the dedicated man embodies
an enduring meaning in his way of life, and thereby the world is formed.
In that which gives things their duration, we can come to understand the
nature of all beings in heaven and on earth.

THE IMAGE

Thunder and wind: the image of DURATION.

Thus the superior man stands firm 
And does not change has direction.

Thunder rolls, and the wind blows; both are examples of extreme mobility
and so are seemingly the very opposite of duration, but the laws governing
their appearance and subsidence, their coming and going, endure. In the
same  way the independence of the superior man is not based on rigidity
and  immobility  of character. He always keeps abreast of the time and changes
with it. What  endures is the unswerving directive, the inner law of his
being, which determines  all his actions.




33. TUN / Retreat
-----------------

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
below  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

The power of the dark is ascending. The light retreats to security,
so that the dark cannot encroach upon it. This retreat is a matter not
of   man's will but of natural law. Therefore in this case withdrawal is
proper;   it is the correct way to behave in order not to exhaust one's forces.
In   the calendar this hexagram is linked with the sixth month (July-August),
in which the forces of winter are already showing their influence.

THE JUDGMENT

RETREAT. Success.
In what is small, perseverance furthers.

Conditions are such that the hostile forces favored by the time are
advancing. In this case retreat is the right course, and it is not to
be   confused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any circumstances,
whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful not to miss
the    right moment while we are in full possession of power and position.
Then   we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time before it is too
late   and to prepare for provisional retreat instead of being drawn into
a desperate    life-and-death struggle. Thus we do not simple abandon the
field to the  opponent;  we make it difficult for him to advance by showing
perseverance  in single  acts of resistance. In this way we prepare, while
retreating, for the counter-movement.   Understanding the laws of a constructive
retreat of this sort is not easy.   The meaning that lies hidden in such
a time is important.

THE IMAGE

Mountain under heaven: the image of RETREAT.

Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,

Not angrily but with reserve.

The mountain rises up under heaven, but owing to its nature it finally
comes to a stop. Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into
the distance and remains out of reach. This symbolizes the behavior of
the   superior man toward a climbing inferior; he retreats into his own thoughts
as the inferior man comes forward. He does not hate him, for hatred is
a  form of subjective involvement by which we are bound to the hated object.
The superior man shows strength (heaven) in that he brings the inferior
man  to a standstill (mountain) by his dignified reserve.




34. Ta Chuang / The Power of the Great
--------------------------------------

above  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

The great lines, that is, the light, strong lines, are powerful. Four
light lines have entered the hexagram from below and are about to ascend
higher. The upper trigram is ChÃªn, the Arousing; the lower is ch'ien,
the Creative. Ch'ien is strong, ChÃªn produces movement. The union
of  movement and strength gives the meaning of THE POWER OF THE GREAT. The
hexagram  is linked with the second month (March-April).

THE JUDGMENT

THE POWER OF THE GREAT. Perseverance furthers.

The hexagram points to a time when inner worth mounts with great force
and comes to power. But its strength has already passed beyond the median
line, hence there is danger that one may rely entirely on one's own power
and forget to ask what is right. There is danger too that, being intent
on  movement, we may not wait for the right time. Therefore the added statement
that perseverance furthers. For that is truly great power which does
not    degenerate into mere force but remains inwardly united with the fundamental
principles of right and of justice. When we understand this point--namely,
that greatness and justice must be indissolubly united--we understand
the    true meaning of all that happens in heaven and on earth.

THE IMAGE

Thunder in heaven above:

The image of THE POWER OF THE GREAT.

Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths

That do not accord with established order.

Thunder--electrical energy--mounts upward in the spring. The direction
of this movement is in harmony with that of the movement of heaven. It
is   therefore a movement in accord with heaven, producing great power.
However,     true greatness depends on being in harmony with what is right.
Therefore    in times of great power the superior man avoids doing anything
that is not   in harmony with the established order.




35. Chin / Progress
-------------------

above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE
below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

The hexagram represents the sun rising over the earth. It is therefore
the symbol of rapid, easy progress, which at the same time means ever
widening    expansion and clarity.

THE JUDGMENT

PROGRESS. The powerful prince
Is honored with horses in large numbers.
In a single day he is granted audience three times.

As an example of progress, this pictures a time when a powerful feudal
lord rallies the other lords around the sovereign and pledges fealty
and    peace. The sovereign rewards him richly and invites him to a closer
intimacy.

A twofold idea is set forth here. The actual effect of the progress
emanates from a man who is in a dependent position and whom the others
regard   as their equal and are therefore willing to follow. This leader
has enough   clarity of vision not to abuse his great influence but to use
it rather for  the benefit of his ruler. His ruler in turn is free of all
jealousy, showers  presents on the great man, and invites him continually
to his court. An enlightened  ruler and an obedient servant--this is the
condition on which  great progress  depends.

THE IMAGE

The sun rises over the earth:

The image of PROGRESS.

Thus the superior man himself
Brightens his bright virtue.

The light of the sun rises over the earth is by nature clear. The
higher the sun rises, the more it emerges from the dark mists, spreading
the pristine purity of its rays over an ever widening area. The real nature
of man is likewise originally good, but it becomes clouded by contact with
earthly things and therefore needs purification before it can shine forth
in its native clarity.




36. Ming I / Darkening of the light
-----------------------------------


above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE

Here the sun has sunk under the earth and is therefore darkened. The
name of the hexagram means literally "wounding of the bright"; hence
the    individual lines contain frequent references to wounding. The situation
is  the exact opposite of that in the foregoing hexagram. In the latter
a  wise  man at the head of affairs has able helpers, and in company with
them  makes  progress; here a man of dark nature is in a position of authority
and brings  harm to the wise and able man.

THE JUDGMENT

DARKENING OF THE LIGHT. In adversity
It furthers one to be persevering.


One must not unresistingly let himself be swept along by unfavorable
circumstances, nor permit his steadfastness to be shaken. He can avoid
this   by maintaining his inner light, while remaining outwardly yielding
and tractable.   With this attitude he can overcome even the greatest adversities.
In some   situations indeed a man must hide his light, in order to make
his will prevail   inspite of difficulties in his immediate environment.
Perseverance must dwell  in inmost consciousness and should not be discernible
from without. Only thus is a man able to maintain his will in the face of
difficulties.

THE IMAGE

The light has sunk into the earth:

The image of DARKENING OF THE LIGHT.

Thus does the superior man live with the great mass:
He veils his light, yet still shines.

In a time of darkness it is essential to be cautious and reserved.
One should not needlessly awaken overwhelming enmity by inconsiderate
behavior.    In such times one ought not to fall in with the practices of
others; neither    should one drag them censoriously into the light.  In
social intercourse   one should not try to be all-knowing. One should let
many things pass, without    being duped.




37. Chia JÃªn / The Family [The Clan]
------------------------------------

above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND
below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE

The hexagram represents the laws obtaining within the family. The
strong line at the top represents the father, the lowest the son. The strong
line in the fifth place represents the husband, the yielding second line
the wife. On the other hand, the two strong lines in the fifth and the third
place represent two brothers, and the two weak lines correlated with them
in the fourth and the second place stand for their respective wives. Thus
all the connections and relationships within the family find their appropriate
expression. Each individual line has the character according with its place.
The fact that a strong line occupies the sixth place-where a weak line might
be expected-indicates very clearly the strong leadership that must come from
the head of the family. The line is to be considered here not in its quality
as the sixth but in its quality as the top line. THE FAMILY shows the laws
operative within the household that, transferred to outside life, keep the
state and the world in order. The influence that goes out from within the
family is represented by the symbol of the wind created by fire.

THE JUDGMENT

THE FAMILY. The perseverance of the woman furthers.

The foundation of the family is the relationship between husband and
wife. The tie that hold the family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance
of the wife. The tie that holds the family together lies in the loyalty
and  perseverance of the wife. Her place is within (second line), while
that  of  the husband is without (fifth line). It is in accord with the great
laws   of nature that husband and wife take their proper places. Within the
family   a strong authority is needed; this is represented by the parents.
If the  father is really a father and the son a son, if the elder brother
fulfills  his position, and the younger fulfills his, if the husband is really
a husband  and the wife a wife, then the family is in order. When the family
is in order,  all the social relationships of mankind will be in order. 
Three of the five  social relationships are to be found within the family-that
between father  and son, which is the relation of love, that between the
husband and wife,  which is the relation of chaste conduct, and that between
elder and younger  brother, which is the relation of correctness. The loving
reverence of the  son is then carried over to the prince in the form of faithfulness
to duty;  the affection and correctness of behavior existing between the
two brothers  are extended to a friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person
of superior  rank in the form of deference. The family is society in the
embryo; it is  the native soil on which performance of moral duty is made
early through natural affection, so that within a small circle a basis of
moral practice is created, and this is later widened to include human relationships
in general.

THE IMAGE

Wind comes forth from fire:

The image of THE FAMILY.Thus the superior man has substance in his
words
And duration in his way of life.

Heat creates energy: this is signified by the wind stirred up by the
fire and issuing forth form it. This represents influence working from
within   outward. The same thing is needed in the regulation of the family.
Here too  the influence on others must proceed form one's own person. In
order to be  capable of producing such an influence, one's words must have
power, and this they can have only if they are based on something real, just
as flame depends on its fuel Words have influence only when they are pertinent
and clearly related to definite circumstances. General discourses and admonitions
have no effect whatsoever. Furthermore, the words must be supported by
one's   entire conduct, just as the wind is made effective by am impression
on others   that they can adapt and conform to it. If words and conduct are
not in accord   and consistent, they will have no effect.





38. K'uei / Opposition
----------------------
above  LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME
below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE

This hexagram is composed of the trigram Li above, i.e., flame, which
burns upward, and Tui below, i.e., the lake, which seeps downward. These
two movements are indirect contrast. Furthermore, LI is the second daughter
and Tui the youngest daughter, and although they live in the same house
they  belong to different men; hence their wills are not the same but are
divergently  directed.

THE JUDGMENT

OPPOSITION. In small matters, good fortune.

When people live in opposition and estrangement they cannot carry
out a great undertaking in common; their points of view diverge too widely.
In such circumstances one should above all not proceed brusquely, for that
would only increase the existing opposition; instead, one should limit oneself
to producing gradual effects in small matters. Here success can still be
expected, because the situation is such that the opposition does not preclude
all agreement.  In general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when
it represents polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful
and important functions. The oppositions of heaven and earth, spirit and
nature, man and woman, when reconciled, bring about the creation and reproduction
of life. In the world of visible things, the principle of opposites makes
possible the differentiation by categories through which order is brought
into the world.

THE IMAGE.

Above, fire; below. The lake.

The image of OPPOSITION.

Thus amid all fellowship 

The superior man retains his individuality.

The two elements, fire and water, never mingle but even when in contact
retain their own natures. So the sutured man is never led into baseness
or  vulgarity through intercourse or community of interests with persons
of another  sort; regardless of all commingling, he will always preserve
his individuality.





39. Chien / Obstruction
-----------------------

above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER
below  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

The hexagram pictures a dangerous abyss lying before us and a steep,
inaccessible mountain rising behind us. We are surrounded by obstacles;
at  the same time, since the mountain has the attribute of keeping still,
there  is implicit a hint as to how we can extricate ourselves. The hexagram
represents  obstructions that appear in the course of time but that can
and  should be  overcome. Therefore all the instruction given is directed
to overcoming  them.

THE JUDGMENT

OBSTRUCTION. The southwest furthers.

The northeast does not further.
It furthers one to see the great man.
Perseverance brings good fortune.

The southwest is the region of retreat, the northeast that of advance.
Here an individual is confronted by obstacles that cannot be overcome
directly.    In such a situation it is wise to pause in view of the danger
and to retreat.    However, this is merely a preparation for overcoming the
obstructions. One   must join forces with friends of like mind and put himself
under the leadership   of a man equal to the situation: then one will succeed
in removing the obstacles.   This requires the will to persevere just when
one apparently  must do something   that leads away from his goal. This unswerving
inner purpose brings good  fortune in the end. An obstruction that lasts
only for a time is useful for  self-development. This is the value of adversity.


THE IMAGE

Water on the mountain:

The image of OBSTRUCTION.

Thus the superior man turns his attention to himself
And molds his character.

Difficulties and obstructions throw a man back upon himself. While
the inferior man seeks to put the blame on other persons, bewailing his
fate,  the superior man seeks the error within himself, and through this
introspection  the external obstacle becomes for him an occasion for inner
enrichment and  education.





40. Hsieh / Deliverance
-----------------------

above  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER
below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER

Here the movement goes out of the sphere of danger. The obstacle has
been removed, the difficulties are being resolved. Deliverance is not
yet    achieved; it is just in its beginning, and the hexagram represents
its various   stages.

THE JUDGMENT

DELIVERANCE. The southwest furthers.
If there is no longer anything where one has to go,
Return brings good fortune.
If there is still something where one has to go,
Hastening brings good fortune.

This refers to a time in which tensions and complications begin to
be eased. At such times we ought to make our way back to ordinary conditions
as soon as possible; this is the meaning of "the southwest." These periods
of sudden change have great importance. Just as rain relieves atmospheric
tension, making all the buds burst open, so a time of deliverance from
burdensome   pressure has a liberating and stimulating effect on life. 
One  thing is important,  however: in such times we must not overdo our triumph.
The point is not to  push on farther than is necessary. Returning to the
regular order of life  as soon as deliverance is achieved brings good fortune.
If there are any residual matters that ought to be attended to, it should
be done as quickly as possible, so that a clean sweep is made and no retardations
occur.

THE IMAGE

Thunder and rain set in:

The image of DELIVERANCE.

Thus the superior man pardons mistakes 
And forgives misdeeds.

A thunderstorm has the effect of clearing the air; the superior man
produces a similar effect when dealing with mistakes and sins of men
that     induce a condition of tension. Through clarity he brings deliverance.
However,    when failings come to light, he does not dwell on them; he simply
passes   over mistakes, the unintentional transgressions, just as thunder
dies away.   He forgives misdeeds, the intentional transgressions, just as
water washes   everything clean.





41. Sun / Decrease
------------------

above  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE

This hexagram represents a decrease of the lower trigram in favor
of the upper, because the third line, originally strong, has moved up to
the top, and the top line, originally weak, has replaced it. What is below
is decreased to the benefit of what is above. This is out-and-out decrease.
If the foundations of a building are decreased in strength and the upper
walls are strengthened, the whole structure loves its stability. Likewise,
a decrease in the prosperity of the people in favor of the government is
out-and-out decrease. And the entire theme of the hexagram is directed to
showing how this shift of wealth can take place without causing the sources
of wealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth in the nation
and its lower classes to fail.

THE JUDGMENT

DECREASE combined with sincerity
Brings about supreme good fortune
Without blame.
One may be persevering in this.
It furthers one to undertake something.
How is this to be carried out?
One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.

Decrease does not under all circumstances mean something bad. Increase
and decrease come in their own time. What matters here is to understand
the  time and not to try to cover up poverty with empty pretense. If a
time   of  scanty resources brings out an inner truth, one must not feel
ashamed   of simplicity. For simplicity is then the very thing needed to
provide inner    strength for further undertakings. Indeed, there need by
no concern if the   outward beauty of the civilization, even the elaboration
of religious forms,   should have to suffer because of simplicity. One must
draw on the strength   of the inner attitude to compensate for what is lacking
in externals; then   the power of the content makes up for the simplicity
of form.  There is no  need of presenting false appearances to God. Even
with slender means,  the  sentiment of the heart can be expressed.

THE IMAGE

At the foot of the mountain, the lake:

The image of DECREASE.

Thus the superior man controls his anger
And restrains his instincts.

The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it decreases
to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture. The
mountain   stands as the symbol of stubborn strength that can harden into
anger. The   lake is the symbol of unchecked gaiety that can develop into
passionate drives  at the expense of the life forces. Therefore decrease
is necessary; anger  must be decreased by keeping still, the instincts must
be curbed by restriction.  By this decrease of the lower powers of the psyche,
the higher aspects of  the soul are enriched/





42. I / Increase
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND
below CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

The idea of increase is expressed in the fact that the strong lowest
line of the upper trigram has sunk down and taken its place under the
lower    trigram. This conception also expresses the fundamental idea on
which the    Book of Changes is based. To rule truly is to serve.  A sacrifice
of the   higher element that produces an increase of the lower is called
an out-and-out   increase: it indicates the spirit that alone has power to
help the world.

THE JUDGMENT

INCREASE. It furthers one

To undertake something.
It furthers one to cross the great water.

Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below
fills the people with a sense of joy and gratitude that is extremely
valuable     for the flowering of the commonwealth. When people are thus
devoted to  their   leaders, undertakings are possible, and even difficult
and dangerous  enterprises   will succeed. Therefore in such times of progress
and successful  development   it is necessary to work and make the best use
of time. This  time resembles   that of the marriage of heaven and earth,
when the earth  partakes of the  creative power of heaven, forming and bringing
forth living  beings. The time  of INCREASE does not endure, therefore it
must be utilized  while it lasts.

THE IMAGE

Wind and thunder: the image of INCREASE.

Thus the superior man:
If he sees good, he imitates it;
If he has faults, he rids himself of them.

While observing how thunder and wind increase and strengthen each
other, a man can not the way to self-increase and self-improvement. When
he discovers good in others, he should imitate it and thus make everything
on earth his own. If he perceives something bad in himself, let him rid himself
of it. In this way he becomes free of evil. This ethical change represents
the most important increase of personality.





43. Kuai / Break-through (Resoluteness)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE
below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

This hexagram signifies on the one hand a break-through after a long
accumulation of tension, as a swollen river breaks through its dikes,
or   in the manner of a cloudburst. On the other hand, applied to human conditions,
it refers to the time when inferior people gradually begin to disappear.
Their influence is on the wane; as a result of resolute action, a change
in conditions occurs, a break-through. The hexagram is linked with the
third    month [April-May].

THE JUDGMENT

BREAK-THROUGH. One must resolutely make the matter known
At the court of the king.
It must be announced truthfully. Danger.
It is necessary to notify one's own city.
It does not further to resort to arms.
It furthers one to undertake something.

Even if only one inferior man is occupying a ruling position in a
city, he is able to oppress superior men. Even a single passion still lurking
in the heart has power to obscure reason. Passion and reason cannot exist
side by side-therefore fight without quarter is necessary if the good is
to prevail.  In a resolute struggle of the good against evil, there are,
however, definite rules that must not be disregarded, if it is to succeed.
First, resolution must be based on a union of strength and friendliness.
Second, a compromise with evil is not possible; evil must under all circumstances
be openly discredited. Nor must our own passions and shortcomings be glossed
over. Third, the struggle must not be carried on directly by force. If evil
is branded, it thinks of weapons, and if we do it the favor of fighting against
it blow for blow, we lose in the end because thus we ourselves get entangled
in hatred and passion. Therefore it is important to begin at home, to be
on guard in our own persons against the faults we have branded. In this way,
finding no opponent, the sharp edges of the weapons of evil becomes dulled.
For the same reasons we should not combat our own faults directly. As long
as we wrestle with them, they continue victorious. Finally, the best way
to fight evil is to make energetic progress in the good.

THE IMAGE

The lake has risen up to heaven:

The image of BREAK-THROUGH.

Thus the superior man
Dispenses riches downward
And refrains from resting on his virtue.

When the water of a lake has risen up to heaven, there is reason to
fear a cloudburst. Taking this as a warning, the superior man forestalls
a violent collapse. If a man were to pile up riches for himself alone,
without    considering others, he would certainly experience a collapse.
If a man were   to pile up riches for himself alone, without considering
others, he would   certainly experience a collapse. For all gathering is
followed by dispersion.   Therefore the superior man begins to distribute
while he is accumulating.   In the same way, in developing his character
he takes care not to become  hardened in obstinacy but to remain receptive
to impressions by help of strict  and continuous self-examination.





44. Kou / Coming to Meet
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND

This hexagram indicates a situation in which the principle of darkness,
after having been eliminated, furtively and unexpectedly obtrudes again
from  within and below. Of its own accord the female principle comes to
meet  the  male. It is an unfavorable and dangerous situation, and we must
understand    and promptly prevent the possible consequences.  The hexagram
is linked  with  the fifth month [June-July], because at the summer solstice
the principle    of darkness gradually becomes ascendant again. 

THE JUDGMENT

COMING TO MEET. The maiden is powerful.
One should not marry such a maiden.

The rise of the inferior element is pictured here in the image of
a bold girl who lightly surrenders herself and thus seizes power. This would
not be possible if the strong and light-giving element had not in turn
come   halfway. The inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a
man delights   in it; it looks so small and weak that he imagines he may
dally with it and  come to no harm.  The inferior man rises only because
the superior man does  not regard him as dangerous and so lends him power.
If he were resisted from  the fist, he could never gain influence.  The time
of COMING TO MEET is important  in still another way. Although as a general
rule the weak should  not come  to meet the strong, there are times when
this has great significance.  When  heaven and earth come to meet each other,
all creatures prosper; when  a prince  and his official come to meet each
other, the world is put in order.  It is  necessary for elements predestined
to be joined and mutually dependent  to  come to meet one another halfway.
But the coming together must be free  of  dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise
harm will result.

THE IMAGE

Under heaven, wind:

The image of COMING TO MEET.

Thus does the prince act when disseminating his commands
And proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.

The situation here resembles that in hexagram 20, Kuan, CONTEMPLATION
( VIEW). In the latter the wind blows over the earth, here it blows under
heaven; in both cases it goes everywhere. There the wind is on the earth
and symbolizes the ruler taking note of the conditions in his kingdom;
here   the wind blows from above and symbolizes the influence exercised by
the ruler   through his commands. Heaven is far from the things of earth,
but it sets   them in motion by means of the wind. The ruler is far form
his people, but   he sets them in motion by means of his commands and decrees.





45.  Ts'ui / Gathering Together [Massing]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE
below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

This hexagram is related in form and meaning to Pi, HOLDING TOGETHER


<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#8">8</a>. In the latter, water is over the earth; here a
lake is over the earth. But since the lake is a place where water collects,
the idea of gathering together is even more strongly expressed here than
in the other hexagram. The same idea also arises from the fact that in
the   present case it is two strong lines (the fourth and the fifth) that
bring   about the gather together, whereas in the former case one strong
line (the   fifth) stands in the midst of weak lines.

THE JUDGMENT

GATHERING TOGETHER. Success.

The king approaches his temple.
It furthers one to see the great man.

This brings success. Perseverance furthers.

To bring great offerings creates good fortune.
It furthers one to undertake something.

The gathering together of people in large communities is either a
natural occurrence, as in the case of the family, or an artificial one, as
in the case of the state. The family gathers about the father as its head.
The perpetuation of this gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice
to the ancestors, at which the whole clan is gathered together. Through the
collective piety of the living members of the family, the ancestors become
so integrated in the spiritual life of the family that it cannot be dispersed
or dissolved.  Where men are to be gathered together, religious forces are
needed. But there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the
group. In order to be able to bring others together, this leader must first
of all be collected within himself. Only collective moral force can unite
the world. Such great times of unification will leave great achievements
behind them. This is the significance of the great offerings that are made.
In the secular sphere likewise there is no need of great deeds in the time
of GATHERING TOGETHER.

THE IMAGE

Over the earth, the lake:

The image of GATHERING TOGETHER.

Thus the superior man renews his weapons
In order to meet the unforeseen.

If the water in the lake gathers until it rises above the earth, there
is danger of a break-through. Precautions must be taken to prevent this.
Similarly where men gather together in great numbers, strife is likely
to   arise; where possessions are collected, robbery is likely to occur.
Thus  in the time of GATHERING TOGETHER we must arm promptly to ward off
the unexpected.   Human woes usually come as a result of unexpected events
against which we   are not forearmed. If we are prepared, they can be prevented.





46.  ShÃªng / Pushing Upward
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH
below SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD

The lower trigram, Sun, represents wood, and the upper, K'un, means
the earth. Linked with this is the idea that wood in the earth grows
upward.     In contrast to the meaning of Chin, PROGRESS 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#35">35</a>, this pushing upward is associated with effort,
just as a plant needs energy for pushing upward through the earth. That
is  why this hexagram, although it is connected with success, is associated
with  effort of the will. In PROGRESS the emphasis is on expansion; PUSHING
UPWARD  indicates rather a vertical ascent-direct rise from obscurity and
lowliness  to power and influence.

THE JUDGMENT

PUSHING UPWARD has supreme success.
One must see the great man.
Fear not.
Departure toward the south
Brings good fortune.

The pushing upward of the good elements encounters no obstruction
and is therefore accompanied by great success. The pushing upward is made
possible not by violence but by modesty and adaptability. Since the individual
is borne along by the propitiousness of the time, he advances.  He must go
to see authoritative people. He need not be afraid to do this, because success
is assured. But he must set to work, for activity (this is the meaning
of   "the south") brings good fortune.

THE IMAGE

Within the earth, wood grows:

The image of PUSHING UPWARD.

Thus the superior man of devoted character
Heaps up small things
In order to achieve something high and great.

Adapting itself to obstacles and bending around them, wood in the
earth grows upward without haste and without rest. Thus too the superior
man is devoted in character and never pauses in his progress.





47. K'un / Oppression (Exhaustion)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE
below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER

The lake is above, water below; the lake is empty, dried up. Exhaustion
is expressed in yet another way: at the top, a dark line is holding down
two light line; below, a light line is hemmed in between two dark ones.
The  upper trigram belongs to the principle of darkness, the lower to the
principle  of light. Thus everywhere superior men are oppressed and held
in restraint  by inferior men.

THE JUDGMENT

OPPRESSION. Success. Perseverance.

The great man brings about good fortune.

No blame.
When one has something to say,
It is not believed.

Times of adversity are the reverse of times of success, but they can
lead to success if they; befall the right man. When a strong man meets
with   adversity, he remains cheerful despite all danger, and this cheerfulness
is the source of later successes; it is that stability which is stronger
than fate. He who lets his spirit be broken by exhaustion certainly has
no  success. But if adversity only bends a man, it creates in him a power
to react that is bound in time to manifest itself. No inferior man is capable
of this. Only the great man brings about goof fortune and remains blameless.
It is true that for the time being outward influence is denied him, because
his words have no effect. Therefore in times of adversity it is important
to be strong within and sparing of words.

THE IMAGE

There is not water in the lake:

The image of EXHAUSTION.

Thus the superior man stakes his life
On following his will.

When the water has flowed out below, the lake must dry up and become
exhausted. That is fate. This symbolizes an adverse fate in human life.
In  such times there is nothing a man can do but acquiesce in his fate
and   remain  true to himself. This concerns the deepest stratum of his being,
for this  alone is superior to all external fate.





48. Ching / The Well
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER 
below SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD

Wood is below, water above. The wood goes down into the earth to bring
up water. The image derives from the pole-and-bucket well of ancient
China.     The wood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were
made of   clay, but rather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled
up from the   well. The image also refers to the world of plants, which lift
water out  of the earth by means of their fibers.  The well from which water
is drawn  conveys the further idea of an inexhaustible dispensing of nourishment.

THE JUDGMENT

THE WELL. The town may be changed,
But the well cannot be changed.
It neither decreases nor increases.

They come and go and draw from the well.
If one gets down almost to the water
And the rope does not go all the way,
Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.

In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for
the sake of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties.
The style of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the
shape    of the well has remained the same from ancient times to this day.
Thus the   well is the symbol of that social structure which, evolved by
mankind in  meeting its most primitive needs, is independent of all political
forms.  Political structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with
its needs remains eternally the same-this cannot be changed. Life is also
inexhaustible.  It grows neither less not more; it exists for one and for
all. The generations    come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible
abundance.  However,    there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political
or social organization    of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations
of life. For any merely    superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest
needs unsatisfied is   as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever
been made. Carelessness-by    which the jug is broken-is also disastrous.
If for instance the military   defense of a state is carried to such excess
that it provokes wars by which   the power of the state is annihilated, this
is a breaking of the jug.  This   hexagram applies also to the individual.
However men may differ in disposition   and in education, the foundations
of human nature are the same in everyone.   And every human being can draw
in the course of his education from the inexhaustible    wellspring of the
divine in man's nature. But here likewise two dangers  threaten:  a man may
fail in his education to penetrate to the real roots  of humanity  and remain
fixed in convention-a partial education of this sort  is as bad  as none-
or he may suddenly collapse and neglect his self-development.

THE IMAGE

Water over wood: the image of THE WELL.

Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,
And exhorts them to help one another.

The trigram Sun, wood, is below, and the trigram K'an, water, is above
it. Wood sucks water upward. Just as wood as an organism imitates the
action    of the well, which benefits all parts of the plant, the superior
man organizes    human society, so that, as in a plant organism, its parts
co-operate for   the benefit of the whole.





49. Ko / Revolution (Molting)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE 
below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE

The Chinese character for this hexagram means in its original sense
an animal's pelt, which is changed in the course of the year by molting.
From this word is carried over to apply to the "moltings" in political
life,   the great revolutions connected with changes of governments.  The
two trigrams    making up the hexagram are the same two that appear in K'uei,
OPPOSITION     

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#38">38</a>, that is, the two younger daughters, Li and Tui.
But while there the elder of the two daughters is above, and what results
is essentially only an opposition of tendencies, here the younger daughter
is above. The influences are in actual conflict, and the forces combat
each   other like fire and water (lake), each trying to destroy the other.
Hence   the idea of revolution.

THE JUDGMENT

REVOLUTION. On your own day
You are believed.

Supreme success,
Furthering through perseverance.
Remorse disappears.

Political revolutions are extremely grave matters. They should be
undertaken only under stress of direst necessity, when there is no other
way out. Not everyone is called to this task, but only the man who has the
confidence of the people, and even he only when the time is ripe. He must
then proceed in the right way, so that he gladdens the people and, by enlightening
them, prevents excesses. Furthermore, he must be quite free of selfish aims
and must really relieve the need of the people. Only then does he have nothing
to regret.  Times change, and with them their demands. Thus the seasons
change  in the course of the year. In the world cycle also there are spring
and autumn  in the life of peoples and nations, and these call for social
transformations.

THE IMAGE

Fire in the lake: the image of REVOLUTION.

Thus the superior man

Sets the calendar in order
And makes the seasons clear.

Fire below and the lake above combat and destroy each other. So too
in the course of the year a combat takes place between the forces of
light     and the forces of darkness, eventuating in the revolution of the
seasons,     and man is able to adjust himself in advance to the demands
of the different     times.





50. Ting / The Caldron
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE 
below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD

The six lines construct the image of Ting, THE CALDRON; at the bottom
are the legs, over them the belly, then come the ears (handles), and
at   the  top the carrying rings. At the same time, the image suggests the
idea   of nourishment. The ting, cast of bronze, was the vessel that held
the cooked    viands in the temple of the ancestors and at banquets. The
heads of the  family  served the food from the ting into the bowls of the
guests.  THE WELL   

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#48">48</a> likewise has the secondary meaning of giving
nourishment, but rather more in relation to the people. The ting, as a utensil
pertaining to a refined civilization, suggests the fostering and nourishing
of able men, which redounded to the benefit of the state.  This hexagram
and THE WELL are the only two in the Book of Changes that represent concrete,
men-made objects. Yet here too the thought has its abstract connotation.
Sun, below, is wood and wind; Li, above, is flame. Thus together they stand
for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea
of preparing food.

THE JUDGMENT

THE CALDRON. Supreme good fortune.

Success.

While THE WELL relates to the social foundation of our life, and this
foundation is likened to the water that serves to nourish growing wood,
the  present hexagram refers to the cultural superstructure of society.
Here  it  is the wood that serves as nourishment for the flame, the spirit.
All  that  is visible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of the
invisible.    Thereby it receives its true consecration and clarity and takes
firm root    in the cosmic order.  Here we see civilization as it reaches
its culmination    in religion. The ting serves in offering sacrifice to
God. The highest earthly   values must be sacrificed to the divine. But the
truly divine does not manifest   itself apart from man. The supreme revelation
of God appears in prophets  and holy men. To venerate them is true veneration
of God. The will of God,  as revealed through them, should be accepted in
humility; this brings inner  enlightenment and true understanding of the
world, and this leads to great  good fortune and success.

THE IMAGE

Fire over wood:

The image of THE CALDRON.

Thus the superior man consolidates his fate 
By making his position correct.

The fate of fire depends on wood; as long as there is wood below,
the fire burns above. It is the same in human life; there is in man likewise
a fate that lends power to his life. And if he succeeds in assigning the
right place to life and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts
his fate on a firm footing. These words contain hints about fostering of
life as handed on by oral tradition in the secret teachings of Chinese yoga.



51. ChÃªn / The Arousing (Shock, Thunder)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER
below  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER

The hexagram ChÃªn represents the eldest son, who seizes rule
with energy and power. A yang line develops below two yin lines and presses
upward forcibly. This movement is so violent that it arouses terror.
It   is  symbolized by thunder, which bursts forth from the earth and by
its shock    causes fear and trembling.

THE JUDGMENT

SHOCK brings success.

Shock comes-oh, oh!
Laughing words -ha, ha!

The shock terrifies for a hundred miles,
And he does not let fall the sacrificial spoon and chalice.

The shock that comes from the manifestation of God within the depths
of the earth makes man afraid, but this fear of God is good, for joy
and    merriment can follow upon it.  When a man has learned within his heart
what   fear and trembling mean, he is safeguarded against any terror produced
by   outside influences. Let the thunder roll and spread terror a hundred
miles   around: he remains so composed and reverent in spirit that the sacrificial
rite is not interrupted. This is the spirit that must animate leaders
and    rulers of men-a profound inner seriousness from which all terrors
glance   off harmlessly.

THE IMAGE

Thunder repeated: the image of SHOCK.

Thus in fear and trembling

The superior man sets his life in order
And examines himself.

The shock of continuing thunder brings fear and trembling. The superior
man is always filled with reverence at the manifestation of God; he sets
his life in order and searches his heart, lest it harbor any secret opposition
to the will of God. Thus reverence is the foundation of true culture.



52. KÃªn / Keeping Still, Mountain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN 
below  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

The image of this hexagram is the mountain, the youngest son of heaven
and earth. The male principle is at the top because it strives upward
by   nature; the female principle is below, since the direction of its movement
has come to its normal end.  In its application to man, the hexagram turns
upon the problem of achieving a quiet heart. It is very difficult to bring
quiet to the heart. While Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing
away    of all movement in nirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is
merely    a state of polarity that always posits movement as its complement.
Possibly    the words of the text embody directions for the practice of yoga.

THE JUDGMENT

KEEPING STILL. Keeping his back still

So that he no longer feels his body.
He goes into his courtyard
And does not see his people.

No blame.

True quiet means keeping still when the time has come to keep still,
and going forward when the time has come to go forward. In this way rest
and movement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there
is light in life.  The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of
all   movement. The back is named because in the back are located all the
nerve   fibers that mediate movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves
is brought  to a standstill, the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as
it were. When  a man has thus become calm, he may turn to the outside world.
He no longer  sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and
therefore he  has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding
the great laws  of the universe and for acting in harmony with them. Whoever
acts from these   deep levels makes no mistakes.

THE IMAGE

Mountains standing close together:

The image of KEEPING STILL.

Thus the superior man
Does not permit his thoughts 

To go beyond his situation.

The heart thinks constantly. This cannot be changed, but the movements
of the heart-that is, a man's thoughts-should restrict themselves to
the    immediate situation. All thinking that goes beyond this only makes
the heart   sore.


53. Chien / Development (Gradual Progress)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD 
below  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

This hexagram is made up of Sun (wood, penetration) above, i.e., without,
and KÃªn (mountain, stillness) below, i.e., within. A tree on a
mountain     develops slowly according to the law of its being and consequently
stands     firmly rooted. This gives the idea of a development that proceeds
gradually,     step by step. The attributes of the trigrams also point to
this: within   is  tranquillity, which guards against precipitate actions,
and without is  penetration,  which makes development and progress possible.

THE JUDGMENT

DEVELOPMENT. The maiden
Is given in marriage.
Good fortune.
Perseverance furthers.

The development of events that leads to a girl's following a man to
his home proceeds slowly. The various formalities must be disposed of
before    the marriage takes place. This principle of gradual development
can be applied   to other situations as well; it is always applicable where
it is a matter   of correct relationships of co-operation, as for instance
in the appointment   of an official. The development must be allowed to take
its proper course.   Hasty action would not be wise. This is also true, finally,
of any effort   to exert influence on others, for here too the essential
factor is a correct   way of development through cultivation of one's own
personality. No influence   such as that exerted by agitators has a lasting
effect.  Within the personality   too, development must follow the same course
if lasting results are to be   achieved. Gentleness that is adaptable, but
at the same time penetrating,   is the outer form that should proceed from
inner calm.  The very gradualness   of the development makes it necessary
to have perseverance, for perseverance   alone prevents slow progress from
dwindling to nothing.

THE IMAGE

On the mountain, a tree:

The image of DEVELOPMENT.

Thus the superior man abides in dignity and virtue,
In order to improve the mores.

The tree on the mountain is visible from afar, and its development
influences the landscape of the entire region. It does not shoot up like
a swamp plant; its growth proceeds gradually. Thus also the work of influencing
people can be only gradual. No sudden influence or awakening is of lasting
effect. Progress must be quite gradual, and in order to obtain such progress
in public opinion and in the mores of the people, it is necessary for
the    personality to acquire influence and weight. This comes about through
careful    and constant work on one's own moral development.





54. Kuei Mei / The Marrying Maiden
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER 
below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE

Above we have ChÃªn, the eldest son, and below, Tui, the youngest
daughter. The man leads and the girl follows him in gladness. The picture
is that of the entrance of the girl into her husband's house. In all,
there    are four hexagrams depicting the relationship between husband and
wife.  Hsien,  INFLUENCE, 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#31">31</a>, describes the attraction that a young couple
have for each other; HÃªng, DURATION 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#32">32</a>, portrays the permanent relationships of marriage;
Chien, DEVELOPMENT 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#53">53</a>, reflects the protracted, ceremonious procedures
attending THE MARRYING MAIDEN, shows a young girl under the guidance
of   an  older man who marries her.

THE JUDGMENT

THE MARRYING MAIDEN.
Undertakings bring misfortune.

Nothing that would further.

A girl who is taken into the family, but not as the chief wife, must
behave with special caution and reserve. She must not take it upon herself
to supplant the mistress of the house, for that would mean disorder and
lead  to untenable relationships.  The same is true of all voluntary relationships
between human beings. While legally regulated relationships based on
personal     inclination depend in the long run entirely on tactful reserve.
Affection     as the essential principle of relatedness is of the greatest
importance   in  all relationships in the world. For the union of heaven
and earth is  the origin of the whole of nature. Among human beings likewise,
spontaneous  affection  is the all-inclusive principle of union.

THE IMAGE

Thunder over the lake:

The image of THE MARRYING MAIDEN.

Thus the superior man
Understands the transitory
In the light of the eternity of the end.

Thunder stirs the water of the lake, which follows it in shimmering
waves. This symbolizes the girl who follows the man of her choice. But
every   relationship between individuals bears within it the danger that
wrong turns   may be taken, leading to endless misunderstandings and disagreements.
Therefore   it is necessary constantly to remain mindful of the end. If
we  permit ourselves   to drift along, we come together and are parted again
as the day may determine.   If on the other hand a man fixes his mind on
an end that endures, he will   succeed in avoiding the reefs that confront
the closer relationships of people.






55. FÃªng / Abundance [Fullness]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER 
below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE

ChÃªn is movement; Li is flame, whose attribute is clarity. Clarity
within, movement without-this produces greatness and abundance. The hexagram
pictures a period of advanced civilization. However, the fact that development
has reached a peak suggests that this extraordinary condition of abundance
cannot be maintained permanently.

THE JUDGMENT

ABUNDANCE has success.

The king attains abundance.
Be not sad.
Be like the sun at midday.

It is not given to every mortal to bring about a time of outstanding
greatness and abundance. Only a born ruler of men is able to do it, because
his will is directed to what is great. Such a time of abundance is usually
brief. Therefore a sage might well feel sad in view of the decline that
must  follow. But such sadness foes not befit him. Only a man who is inwardly
free  of sorrow and care can lead in a time of abundance. He must be like
the sun  at midday, illuminating and gladdening everything under heaven.

THE IMAGE

Both thunder and lightning come:

The image of ABUNDANCE.

Thus the superior man decides lawsuits
And carries out punishments.

This hexagram has a certain connection with Shih Ho, BITING THROUGH


<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#21">21</a>, in which thunder and lightning similarly appear
together, but in the reverse order. In BITING THROUGH, laws are laid
down;     here they are applied and enforced. Clarity [Li] within makes it
possible     to investigate the facts exactly, and shock [ChÃªn] without
ensures    a strict and precise carrying out of punishments.





56. LÃ¼ / The Wanderer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE 
below  KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

the mountain, KÃªn, stands still; above it fire, Li, flames up
and does not tarry. Therefore the two trigrams do not stay together.
Strange     lands and separation are the wanderer's lot. When a man is a
wanderer and    stranger, he should not be gruff nor overbearing. He has
no large circle   of acquaintances, therefore he should not give himself
airs. He must be cautious   and reserved; in this way he protects himself
from evil. If he is obliging   toward others, he wins success.  A wanderer
has no fixed abode; his home  is the road. Therefore he must take care to
remain upright and steadfast,  so that he sojourns only in the proper places,
associating only with good  people. Then he has good fortune and can go his
way unmolested.

THE IMAGE

Fire on the mountain:

The image of THE WANDERER.

Thus the superior man
Is clear-minded and cautious
In imposing penalties,
And protracts no lawsuits.

When grass on a mountain takes fire, there is bright light. However,
the fire does not linger in one place, but travels on to new fuel. It
is   a phenomenon of short duration. This is what penalties and lawsuits
should   be like. They should be a quickly passing matter, and must not be
dragged   out indefinitely. Prisons ought to be places where people are lodged
only   temporarily, as guests are. They must not become dwelling places.





57. Sun / The Gentle (The Penetrating, Wind)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD 
below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD

Sun is one of the eight doubled trigrams. It is the eldest daughter
and symbolizes wind or wood; it has for its attribute gentleness, which
nonetheless  penetrates like the wind or like growing wood with its roots.
The dark principle,  in itself rigid and immovable, is dissolved by the
penetrating light principle,  to which it subordinates itself in gentleness.
In nature, it is the wind that disperses the gathered clouds, leaving the
sky clear and serene. In human life it is penetrating clarity of judgment
that thwarts all dark hidden motives. In the life of the community it is
the powerful influence of a great personality that uncovers and breaks up
those intrigues which shun the light of day.

THE JUDGMENT

THE GENTLE. Success through what is small.
It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
It furthers one to see the great man.

Penetration produces gradual and inconspicuous effects. It should
be effected not by an act of violation but by influence that never lapses.
Results of this kind are less striking to the eye than those won by surprise
attack, but they are more enduring and more complete. If one would produce
such effects, one must have a clearly defined goal, for only when the penetrating
influence works always in the same direction can the object be attained.
Small strength can achieve its purpose only by subordinating itself to an
eminent man who is capable of creating order.

THE IMAGE

Winds following one upon the other:

The image of THE GENTLY PENETRATING.

Thus the superior man 

Spreads his commands abroad
And carries out his undertakings.

The penetrating quality of the wind depends upon its ceaselessness.
This is what makes it so powerful; time is its instrument. In the same
way   the ruler's thought should penetrate the soul of the people. This
too  requires   a lasting influence brought about by enlightenment and command.
Only when   the command has been assimilated by the people is action in
accordance  with   it possible. Action without preparation of the ground
only frightens  and  repels.





58. Tui / The Joyous, Lake
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE 
below TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE

This hexagram, like sun, is one of the eight formed by doubling of
a trigram. The trigram Tui denotes the youngest daughter; it is symbolized
by the smiling lake, and its attribute is joyousness. Contrary to appearances,
it is not the yielding quality of the top line that accounts for joy
here.     The attribute of the yielding or dark principle is not joy but
melancholy.     However, joy is indicated by the fact that there are two
strong lines within,    expressing themselves through the medium of gentleness.
True joy, therefore,    rests on firmness and strength within, manifesting
itself outwardly as yielding   and gentle.

THE JUDGMENT

THE JOYOUS. Success.
Perseverance is favorable.

The joyous mood is infectious and therefore brings success. But joy
must be based on steadfastness if it is not to degenerate into uncontrolled
mirth. Truth and strength must dwell in the heart, while gentleness reveals
itself in social intercourse. In this way one assumes the right attitude
toward God and man and achieves something. Under certain conditions, intimidation
without gentleness may achieve something momentarily, but not for all
time.    When, on the other hand, the hearts of men are won by friendliness,
they   are led to take all hardships upon themselves willingly, and if need
be will  not shun death itself, so great is the power of joy over men.

THE IMAGE

Lakes resting one on the other:

The image of THE JOYOUS.

Thus the superior man joins with his friends
For discussion and practice.

A lake evaporates upward and thus gradually dries up; but when two
lakes are joined they do not dry up so readily, for one replenishes the
other.  It is the same in the field of knowledge. Knowledge should be a
refreshing    and vitalizing force. It becomes so only through stimulating
intercourse   with congenial friends with whom one holds discussion and practices
application    of the truths of life. In this way learning becomes many-sided
and takes   on a cheerful lightness, whereas there is always something ponderous
and  one-sided about the learning of the self-taught.





59. Huan / Dispersion [Dissolution]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND 
below K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER

Wind blowing over water disperses it, dissolving it into foam and
mist. This suggests that when a man's vital energy is dammed up within him
(indicated as a danger by the attribute of the lower trigram), gentleness
serves to break up and dissolve the blockage.

THE JUDGMENT

DISPERSION. Success.

The king approaches his temple.
It furthers one to cross the great water.
Perseverance furthers.

The text of this hexagram resembles that of Ts'ui, GATHERING TOGETHER


<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#45">45</a>. In the latter, the subject is the bringing together
of elements that have been separated, as water collects in lakes upon
the    earth. Here the subject is the dispersing and dissolving of divisive
egotism.    DISPERSION shows the way, so to speak, that leads to gathering
together.   This explains the similarity of the two texts.  Religious forces
are needed   to overcome the egotism that divides men. The common celebration
of the great   sacrificial feasts and sacred rites, which gave expression
simultaneously    to the interrelation and social articulation of the family
and state, was    the means of employed by the great ruler to unite men.
The sacred music  and  the splendor of the ceremonies aroused a strong tide
of emotion that  was shared by all hearts in unison, and that awakened a
consciousness of the common origin of all creatures. In this way disunity
was overcome and rigidity dissolved. A further means to the same end is co-operation
in great general undertakings that set a high goal for the will of the people;
in the common concentration on this goal, all barriers dissolve, just as,
when a boat is crossing a great stream, all hands must unite in a joint
task.   But only a man who is himself free of all selfish ulterior considerations,
and who perseveres in justice and steadfastness, is capable of so dissolving
the hardness of egotism.

THE IMAGE

The wind drives over the water:

The image of DISPERSION.

Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord
And built temples.

In the autumn and winter, water begins to freeze into ice. When the
warm breezes of spring come, the rigidity is dissolved, and the elements
that have been dispersed in ice floes are reunited. It is the same with
the  minds of the people. Through hardness and selfishness the heart grows
rigid,  and this rigidity leads to separation from all others. Egotism and
cupidity  isolate men. Therefore the hearts of men must be seized by a devout
emotion.  They must be shaken by a religious awe in face of eternity-stirred
with an  intuition of the One Creator of all living beings, and united through
the  strong feeling of fellowship experienced in the ritual of divine worship.





60. Chieh / Limitation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER 
below TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE

A lake occupies a limited space. When more water comes into it, it
overflows. Therefore limits must be set for the water. The image shows
water   below and water above, with the firmament between them as a limit.
The Chinese  word for limitation really denotes the joints that divide
a  bamboo stalk.  In relation to ordinary life it means the thrift that sets
fixed limits upon  expenditures. In relation to the moral sphere it means
the fixed limits that  the superior man sets upon his actions-the limits
of loyalty and disinterestedness.

THE JUDGMENT

LIMITATION. Success.
Galling limitation must not be persevered in.

Limitations are troublesome, but they are effective. If we live economically
in normal times, we are prepared for times of want. To be sparing saves
us  from humiliation. Limitations are also indispensable in the regulation
of  world conditions. In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter,
day and night, and these limits give the year its meaning. In the same
way,   economy, by setting fixed limits upon expenditures, acts to preserve
property   and prevent injury to the people.  But in limitation we must
observe  due  measure. If a man should seek to impose galling limitations
upon his  own nature, it would be injurious. And if he should go too far
in imposing  limitations  on others, they would rebel. Therefore it is necessary
to set  limits even  upon limitation.

THE IMAGE

Water over lake: the image of LIMITATION.

Thus the superior man
Creates number and measure,
And examines the nature of virtue and correct conduct.

A lake is something limited. Water is inexhaustible. A lake can contain
only a definite amount of the infinite quantity of water; this is its
peculiarity.    In human life too the individual achieves significance through
discrimination    and the setting of limits. Therefore what concerns us here
is the problem    of clearly defining these discriminations, which are, so
to speak, the backbone   of morality. Unlimited possibilities are not suited
to man; if they existed,   his life would only dissolve in the boundless.
To become strong, a man's  life needs the limitations ordained by duty and
voluntarily accepted. The  individual attains significance as a free spirit
only by surrounding himself  with these limitations and by determining for
himself what his duty is.





61. Chung Fu / Inner Truth
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND 
below TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE

The wind blows over the lake and stirs the surface of the water. Thus
visible effects of the invisible manifest themselves. The hexagram consists
of firm lines above and below, while it is open in the center. This indicates
a heart free of prejudices and therefore open to truth. On the other
hand,     each of the two trigrams has a firm line in the middle; this indicates
the   force of inner truth in the influences they present.  The attributes
of the  two trigrams are: above, gentleness, forbearance toward inferiors;
below,   joyousness in obeying superiors. Such conditions create the basis
of a mutual   confidence that makes achievements possible.  The character
of fu ("truth")   is actually the picture of a bird's foot over a fledgling.
It suggests the   idea of brooding. An egg is hollow. The light-giving power
must work to quicken  it from outside, but there must be a germ of life
within,  if life is to be  awakened. Far-reaching speculations can be linked
with these ideas.

THE JUDGMENT

INNER TRUTH. Pigs and fishes.
Good fortune.
It furthers one to cross the great water.
Perseverance furthers.

Pigs and fishes are the least intelligent of all animals and therefore
the most difficult to influence. The force of inner truth must grow great
indeed before its influence can extend to such creatures. In dealing
with     persons as intractable and as difficult to influence as a pig or
a fish,    the whole secret of success depends on finding the right way of
approach.    One must first rid oneself of all prejudice and, so to speak,
let the psyche    of the other person act on one without restraint. Then
one will establish    contact with him, understand and gain power over him.
When a door has thus    been opened, the force of one's personality will
influence him. If in this    way one finds no obstacles insurmountable, one
can undertake even the most    dangerous things, such as crossing the great
water, and succeed.  But it   is important to understand upon what the force
inner truth depends. This  force is not identical with simple intimacy or
a secret bond. Close ties may exist also among thieves; it is true that such
a bond acts as a force but, since it is not invincible, it does not bring
good fortune. All association  on the basis of common interests holds only
up to a certain point. Where the community of interest ceases, the holding
together ceases also, and the closest friendship often changes into hate.
Only when the bond is based on what is right, on steadfastness, will it remain
so firm that it triumphs over everything.

THE IMAGE

Wind over lake: the image of INNER TRUTH.

Thus the superior man discusses criminal cases 
In order to delay executions.

Wind stirs water by penetrating it. Thus the superior man, when obliged
to judge the mistakes of men, tries to penetrate their minds with understanding,
in order to gain a sympathetic appreciation of the circumstances. In
ancient     China, the entire administration of justice was guided by this
principle.     A deep understanding that knows how to pardon was considered
the highest    form of justice. This system was not without success, for
its aim was to   make so strong a moral impression that there was no reason
to fear abuse  of such mildness. For it sprang not from weakness but from
a superior clarity.






62. Hsiao Kuo / Preponderance of the Small
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above CHÃªN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER 
below KÃªN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

While in the hexagram Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#28">28</a>, the strong lines preponderate and are within,
inclosed between weak lines at the top and bottom, the present hexagram
has  weak lines preponderating, though here again they are on the outside,
the  strong lines being within. This indeed is the basis of the exceptional
situation  indicated by the hexagram. When strong lines are outside, we
have  the hexagram  I, PROVIDING NOURISHMENT 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#27">27</a>, or Chung Fu, INNER TRUTH, 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#61">61</a>; neither represents and exceptional state. When
strong elements within preponderate, they necessarily enforce their will.
This creates struggle and exceptional conditions in general. But in the
present  hexagram it is the weak element that perforce must mediate with
the outside  world. If a man occupies a position of authority for which
he  is by nature  really inadequate, extraordinary prudence is necessary.

THE JUDGMENT

PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL. Success.
Perseverance furthers.

Small things may be done; great things should not be done.

The flying bird brings the message:
It is not well to strive upward,
It is well to remain below.
Great good fortune.

Exceptional modesty and conscientiousness are sure to be rewarded
with success; however, if a man is not to throw himself away, it is important
that they should not become empty form and subservience but be combined always
with a correct dignity in personal behavior. We must understand the demands
of the time in order to find the necessary offset for its deficiencies
and   damages. In any event we must not count on great success, since the
requisite   strength is lacking. In this lies the importance of the message
that one  should not strive after lofty things but hold to lowly things.
The structure  of the hexagram gives rise to the idea that this message
is brought by a bird. In Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#28">28</a>, the four strong, heavy lines within, supported
only by two weak lines without, give the image of a sagging ridgepole.
Here   the supporting weak lines are both outside and preponderant; this
gives the  image of a soaring bird. But a bird should not try to surpass
itself and fly into the sun; it should descend to the earth, where its nest
is. In this way it gives the message conveyed by the hexagram.

THE IMAGE

Thunder on the mountain:

The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL.

Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.
In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.
In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.

Thunder on the mountain is different from thunder on the plain. In
the mountains, thunder seems much nearer; outside the mountains, it is
less   audible than the thunder of an ordinary storm. Thus the superior
man  derives   an imperative from this image: he must always fix his eyes
more  closely and  more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even
though  this might  make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He
is exceptionally  conscientious   in his actions. In bereavement emotion
means more to him than ceremoniousness.   In all his personal expenditures
he is extremely simple and unpretentious.   In comparison with the man of
the masses, all this makes him stand out as   exceptional. But the essential
significance of his attitude lies in the fact  that in external matters he
is on the side of the lowly.





63. Chi Chi / After Completion
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER 
below  LI THE  CLINGING, FIRE

This hexagram is the evolution of T'ai PEACE 

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#11">11</a>. The transition from confusion to order is completed,
and everything is in its proper place even in particulars. The strong
lines    are in the strong places, the weak lines in the weak places. This
is a very   favorable outlook, yet it gives reason for thought. For it is
just when perfect  equilibrium has been reached that any movement may cause
order to revert to disorder. The one strong line that has moved to the top,
thus effecting  complete order in details, is followed by the other lines.
Each moving according  to its nature, and thus suddenly there arises again
the hexagram P'i, STANDSTILL     

<a href="http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#12">12</a>.  Hence the present hexagram indicates the conditions
of a time of climax, which necessitate the utmost caution.

THE JUDGMENT

AFTER COMPLETION. Success in small matters. 
Perseverance furthers. 
At the beginning good fortune. 
At the end disorder. 

The transition from the old to the new time is already accomplished.
In principle, everything stands systematized, and it si only in regard
to   details that success is still to be achieved. In respect to this, however,
we must be careful to maintain the right attitude. Everything proceeds
as   if of its own accord, and this can all too easily tempt us to relax
and let  thing take their course without troubling over details. Such indifference
is the root of all evil. Symptoms of decay are bound to be the result.
Here   we have the rule indicating the usual course of history. But this
rule is   not an inescapable law. He who understands it is in position to
avoid its   effects by dint of unremitting perseverance and caution.

THE IMAGE

Water over fire: the image of the condition 
In AFTER COMPLETION.

Thus the superior man 

Takes thought of misfortune
And arms himself against it in advance.

When water in a kettle hangs over fire, the two elements stand in
relation and thus generate energy (cf. the production of steam). But the
resulting tension demands caution. If the water boils over, the fire is extinguished
an its energy is lost. If the heat is too great, the water evaporates
into    the air. These elements here brought in to relation and thus generating
energy  are by nature hostile to each other. Only the most extreme caution
can prevent  damage. In life too there are junctures when all forces are
in balance and  work in harmony, so that everything seems to be in the best
of order. In such times only the sage recognizes the moments that bode danger
and knows how to banish it by means of timely precautions.





64. Wei Chi / Before Completion
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

above LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME
below K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER

This hexagram indicates a time when the transition from disorder to
order is not yet completed. The change is indeed prepared for, since
all    the lines in the upper trigram are in relation to those in the lower.
However,     they are not yet in their places. While the preceding hexagram
offers an   analogy to autumn, which forms the transition from summer to
winter, this   hexagram presents a parallel to spring, which leads out of
winter's stagnation   into the fruitful time of summer. With this hopeful
outlook the Book of Changes   come to its close.

THE JUDGMENT

BEFORE COMPLETION. Success.
But if the little fox, after nearly completing the crossing,
Gets his tail in the water,

There is nothing that would further.

The conditions are difficult. The task is great and full of responsibility.
It is nothing less than that of leading the world out of confusion back
to  order. But it is a task that promises success, because there is a goal
that  can unite the forces now tending in different directions. At first,
however,  one must move warily, like an old fox walking over ice. The caution
of a fox walking over ice is proverbial in China. His ears are constantly
alert to the cracking of the ice, as he carefully and circumspectly searches
out the safest spots. A young fox who as yet has not acquired this caution
goes ahead boldly, and it may happen that he falls in and gets his tail
wet  when he is almost across the water. Then of course his effort has been
all  in vain. Accordingly, in times "before completion," deliberation and
caution   are the prerequisites of success.

THE IMAGE

Fire over water:

The image of the condition before transition.

Thus the superior man is careful
In the differentiation of things,

So that each finds its place.

When fire, which by nature flames upward, is above, and water, which
flows downward, is below, their effects take opposite directions and
remain     unrelated. If we wish to achieve an effect, we must first investigate
the    nature of the forces in question and ascertain their proper place.
If we   can bring these forces to bear in the right place, they will have
the desired    effect and completion will be achieved. But in order to handle
external  forces  properly, we must above all arrive at the correct standpoint
ourselves,  for  only from this vantage can we work correctly.
